title: The quantum measurement problem (and why many worlds don't save you)
description:
---

## Intro

Like many quantum novices, I once thought that decoherence or the
many-worlds interpretation solved the measurement problem -- namely,
why I always see a definite state instead of a superposition. But
that's not quite correct. Since many people seem to harbor the same
misunderstandings, I thought I'd share this note.

### Summary

Consider a Schrodinger's Cat style experiment.

Regardless of interpretation, there is a point in time before which
you cannot say that there is an answer, and after which you can. From
your perspective, an answer suddenly comes into being. This transition
either happens due to some collapse mechanism, or upon your encountering
the experiment.

This is not rectified by either decoherence or many worlds.


### Superposition, interference, and entanglement: a brief recap

Say we have a single particle that's in a superposition of two states[1].
We can do what's called an *interference experiment*[2] on it to
demonstrate that it's really in a superposition, and not just "in one
state but we don't know which."

If it interacts with another particle in such a way that the second 
particle's behavior depends on the first particle's state, then the
two are said to be entangled. They are in superposition *together*.

For example, if the first particle was in a superposition of "moving
left + moving right," and it bounces off a stationary particle, then the 
two may end up in "first particle moving right and second moving left +
first particle moving left and second moving right."

This is just the conservation of momentum applied to each branch
separately. In a sense, that's all entanglement *is*: when the usual 
laws of physics are applied to each branch of the superposition, it 
generally results in different *outcomes* for each branch. Then 
knowledge about one of the particles tells you something about the other 
particle[3].

At this point, if we have full control over both particles, we can 
still demonstrate superposition on the *pair*. If we only have 
control of the *first* particle, however, an interference experiment 
would show nothing[4]. Whether or not we actually *try* that
interference experiment, the behavior of the first particle would *look*
classical (as though it were in *one* state, even if we don't know which).

The information we need has "leaked into" the second particle, and can
only be recovered by gaining control of it.

### Decoherence

If the particles encounter a detection device, that device's whole 
*job* is to leak information in a big way. In one branch, the alarm
should be blaring, and in the other, it is silent. That's trillions of
particles that are in on the entanglement together.

Even if there's no explicit detection device, if stray air molecules or 
photons encounter the pair, they will carry away information (which 
potentially propagates away at the speed of light), acting as a sort
of detector. If the "detector" is a device that kills (or doesn't kill) a 
cat, then the unfortunate cat becomes a kind of detector.

In either case, we would need control of *all* of those particles in 
order to demonstrate the superposition that they all belong to, or to
undo most of the entanglements so that we can demonstrate interference 
on a much smaller subset. But that's virtually impossible with current
or foreseeable technology.

Since we normally only have precise control over a tiny subset of these 
particles, we cannot demonstrate interference[13].

That's basically what decoherence is. It's a way of explaining why
macroscopic systems don't "look quantum" (e.g., they do not show
interference patterns).

>"Whenever a quantum system gets entangled with another system, its coherence is reduced. However, the term 'decoherence' is typically reserved to situations in which the loss of coherence is **effectively** permanent and **difficult** to reverse or avoid." 


But while the branches of the superposition cannot interfere *in
practice*, it does not deny that they are there *in principle.* And if
the superposition is still there in principle, then it is not valid to
say that there is just one outcome -- even if it's a perfectly good
approximation for all practical purposes.

This is why decoherence does not solve the measurement problem[5].


### The measurement problem

So when should we be allowed to say that the first particle *really* 
has a definite value? This is the heart of the measurement problem,
and we're not going to solve it here. But note that we *can* put an
upper bound on the problem.

Namely, when I *see* the result, I ought to be able to say that there
*is* a result. If I encounter a decomposing cat, I would really like it
to be meaningful to say "this cat is *really* dead."

It is not enough that my *friend* sees it -- for all I know, she is 
merely part of the superposition, however impractical it may be for me
to demonstrate. On the other hand, if my friend sees it and *tells* me,
then this is as good as me seeing it myself. Either way, the 
superposition has grown to involve me.

Early in the experiment, there was *no* meaningful sense in which there 
was just one result. Now, there clearly *is* a meaningful sense. When
did that sense come into being?

It's easy to slip into thinking that maybe decoherence makes the
result *slowly* come into existence or something, but this is not good
enough: as we saw, decoherence *never* denies the reality of the
superposition, so it *never* causes there to be just one answer in
principle. And yet I want to *say* there is one answer in principle,
because... dead cat.

### Collapse

One explanation might be that there is a "collapse" that happens
somewhere. The problem is, there's not much theoretical or experimental
evidence of such an event happening anywhere, and anyway it would
violate the time-reversibility of physics. Suffice it to say that
nobody likes this idea very much[6]. 

Nonetheless, the term "Copenhagen interpretation" is frequently used
to describe a vague idea in which collapse probably happens
somewhere, somewhen, somehow, and it continues to be a favorite of
physicists for mostly practical reasons.

> *I think Copenhagen is completely ill-defined, and shouldn’t be the favorite anything of any thoughtful person*
> -- Sean Carroll, ["The most embarrassing graph in physics"](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/01/17/the-most-embarrassing-graph-in-modern-physics/)

Recall that we put an upper bound on when this "collapse" must happen:
by the time we see it. So either we must be able to *cause* it, or it
must happen at tiny scales (preventing us from getting inside the
boundary)[7].

It is also worth noting that some researchers are looking for evidence
of irreversible decoherence. If such a thing is found, it should be
physically indistinguishable from a "real collapse": the branches
cannot interfere in principle, and so within each branch it looks like
there suddenly became one final answer.

### Many worlds to the rescue?

A more modern interpretation is that collapse *never* happens. Instead, 
we must widen our lens.

From a "God's-eye view," the superposition simply grows to *include* us
when we encounter it. In one branch, a copy of us sees one result, and
in another branch, another copy sees the other result. This is called
the "many worlds interpretation" (MWI).

But consider how things look for any single *copy* of you. This 
shouldn't be too onerous, since are *always* just "one single copy of 
you."

If a collapse never happens, then the boundary between which there is
*no* answer, and which there *is* an answer, is when I see it. The
answer somehow "comes into being" when I see it -- *in a (theoretically) 
physically verifiable sense.*

This is another place where people seem to lose the plot. Let's look
at some common objections:

&nbsp;

* Q: Big deal, you discover the answer when you encounter it.

* A: Unless there was a collapse, there *was* no answer before you 
encountered it.

&nbsp;

* Q: From a God's-eye view, it is *still* in a superposition, so there is
never a point at which there becomes just one answer.

* A: Yes, but from *your* perspective, there is. You, as a physicist with
sufficiently advanced technology, will discover that this point only
happens when you, personally, encounter the system.

&nbsp;

* Q: But if it's still in a superposition, then someone still outside
the system can theoretically undo your entanglement, and so your answer
is not really a "final answer."

* A: Again, true but irrelevant. There is still a moment where an answer
"pops into being," regardless of whether it can later be undone[12].

&nbsp;

Whether or not there is a "real collapse," and regardless of 
interpretation, from *your* perspective, there *is* a point at which 
an answer "comes into being"; where there *is* an answer now but 
*wasn't* before. 

In addition, though we might be able to say now that the cat *has 
been dead* for some time, even that fact wasn't meaningfully
true a moment ago. The present and past truth of the cat's fate come 
into being simultaneously.

If you accept MWI and not collapse, then you must also accept that
this "moment of truth" happens with *you*. You are the *only observer 
in your branch of the universe* -- i.e., in the world[8].

### A note on consciousness

Sometimes people misunderstand and think that detectors have to be
conscious. As we saw, this is of course wrong. Any physical system that
entangles with the experiment is a "detector."

On the other hand, some people then conclude that since I also only
entangle with the system, and I am just another detector, consciousness
has *nothing* to do with quantum mechanics.

IMHO, this is just as misguided.

Recall the "upper bound" we placed on the (apparent) collapse: it is
when "I see the result." If you try to make precise what you *mean* by
those words, you will discover that you are trying to make precise the
statement that you *become conscious of* the result.

The "collapse" may happen *before* this point (e.g., you can claim that
it happens in unconscious parts of your brain), but somehow it never
happens *after*. This is what it *means* for there to be a measurement
problem: somehow, by the time I become aware of the result, I must say 
that there really is one.

I am of course free to try to extrapolate this conclusion to other 
physical systems (such as detectors or other people), but they either
end up in different worlds or cause collapse in mine (or ours).

#### A personal note

I might as well share my own views here. **Feel free to disregard or mock
them as you see fit**. I will only give a rough sketch; a longer piece
with more details is in the works.

Consider various philosophical conundrums:

* [Last Thursdayism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism):
there is no way to know whether the past really happened[9].
* [The problem of induction](stephenlaw.blogspot.com/2012/10/problem-of-induction-explained-simply.html): the
principle of induction relies on circularity, and thus *any* certainty
that the laws of physics will continue to operate tomorrow is unjustified[10].
* [The problem of other minds](www.iep.utm.edu/solipsis/): there's no
way to be sure that anyone else is conscious[11].

These all find convergence in a simple (if radical) idea: namely, that your 
experience of the world *is* the world. It is not that consciousness
is a property you have (and that nobody else does). It is that
consciousness is the very "fabric" of all the sights and sounds and
ideas you experience, and they together make up the thing you call
"the world." Look around and make this shift in perspective. Sounds
are manifestations of a luminous property called "consciousness." If
it helps, compare the *presence* of sound with its *absence.* This
presence that constitutes sound *is* consciousness.

You are not conscious; your body, thoughts, personality, etc. are 
always a *content* of consciousness.

Sometimes this fabric manifests as the perspective you call "my friend's
conscious experience." This happens neither in parallel with yours,
nor sequentially, but in a sense,
[beyond time](www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html). You only
ever experience your own projections of other people.

The truth comes into existence when "you become conscious" of it
because consciousness *is the world*.

As for why there are all the perceived regularities called "physics,"
these are all occurring in much deeper layers of mind than our profoundly
distracted minds normally have access to. But they are not beyond conscious
reach *in principle*. This is the entire point of certain [contemplative
traditions](contemplative.html), though they are frequently 
misunderstood. There are things you cannot prove
because if you stopped *doing them*, they would stop *happening,* in
a physically meaningful sense.

More will have to wait til later.

## Notes and references

1. Note that with some observables, such as spin, the particle can be 
in a definite state and *still* be in a superposition with respect to 
another observable. For example,

   `|z_-> = sqrt(2)/2 * ( |x_+> + |x_-> )`

   This says that when a particle is spin-down along the z-axis, it is
in a superposition along the x-axis. See [Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices#Eigenvectors_and_eigenvalues). The fact that
measuring it in the z-axis will yield a definite result (spin-down)
even though "it is in a superposition" can be seen as an interference
effect (see [2]).

2. Consider a qubit in state `|psi> = |0> + |1>` measured with respect 
to the following basis:

   `{ |A> = |0> + |1>, |B> = |0> - |1> }`

   Note that because `<B|psi> = 0`, the result will never be `B`. This
result can be interpreted as the result of interference. In particular,
`<B|0>` and `<B|1>` (the "two paths" from `|psi>` to `|B>`) have
opposite amplitudes and are said to "destructively interfere."

3. Consider the case of a perfectly elastic collision where the two
particles have the same mass. Then, when the first particle "bumps into"
the second, the first will *stop*. The resulting state will be
"first particle stopped and second moving left + first particle stopped
and second moving right." In this case, knowing the first particle's
motion does *not* tell you anything about the second particle's, and
the two momenta are not entangled.

4. Continuing from note [2]:

   Let the qubit `|psi>` become entangled with a "measuring device":

   `|psi'> = |0>|X> + |1>|Y>`

   With `|X>` and `|Y>` orthornormal.

   If you calculate the probability of the left subsystem being measured as `|B>`
and ignoring the second particle (e.g., by applying the projector `P_B @ I`), 
you will find that it is
50%, as would be predicted if the particle were in a *classically*
indeterminate mixture of `|0>` and `|1>`. The interference has
"disappeared" with respect to either sub-system alone. In the density
matrix formulation, this is equivalent to taking the
[partial trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_trace) and
noticing that the off-diagonal terms have disappeared.

   On the other hand, because `|psi'>` is still just a superposition
(in the tensor-product space spanned by
`{ |0>|X>, |0>|Y>, |1>|X>, |1>|Y> }`),
we can still demonstrate interference on it (e.g., by noting that it
is never measured as `|0>|X> - |1>|Y>` or by undoing the entanglement).
This requires control of both systems.

   Another interesting thing to note is that the interference on `psi`
disappears only insofar as `|X>` and `|Y>` have a smaller inner product.
In other words, there are *degrees* of entanglement. The more strongly
the particles are entangled -- the more that the second particle's state
gives information about the first's -- the less interference we can
demonstrate.

5. [The decoherence myth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

   > Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

   Roger Penrose (2004), The Road to Reality, pp. 802-803:
   > ...the environmental-decoherence viewpoint ... maintains that state 
vector reduction can be understood as coming about because the
environmental system under consideration becomes inextricably entangled
with its environment.[...] We think of the environment as extremely
complicated and essentially 'random' [... but] there is no general 
principle providing an
absolute bar to extracting information from the environment.[...]
Accordingly, such descriptions are referred to as FAPP [For All Practical
Purposes].

6. [Leonard Susskind](https://youtu.be/iNgIl-qIklU?t=3m3s), relating
how he and Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft disproved an idea of Stephen
Hawking:

   > In fact, I think of it as more basic than any of the other principles
of physics. The most basic principle of physics is that distinctions
never disappear.

   Nonetheless, there are modern ["objective collapse"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_collapse_theory) theories like [GRW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghirardi%E2%80%93Rimini%E2%80%93Weber_theory).
But they seem not to be very popular.

7. Or we discover we *can* get inside the boundary and experience something very strange. But this is just sci-fi right now.

8. Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner is most (in)famous for his idea that
[consciousness causes collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretation). What's less well known
is that he probably did it to avoid approximately the same conclusion we're 
arriving at:

   > *This [reduction of the quantum state] takes place whenever the result
  of an observation enters the
  consciousness of the observer - or, to be even more painfully precise,
  my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people
  being only subjects of my observations.*
   >
   > &nbsp; ...
   >
   > *However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
  extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
  people, in their hearts, will go along with it.*

9. I don't have space to argue it in the footnotes, but it's much worse
than "I can't know whether the past really happened." All attempts to
*support* that the past really happened (e.g., by invoking physical law,
or trying to justify Occam's Razor) end up *presupposing* the past.
Because all attempts to justify the past end up being circular, there's
no way to say that a real past is even "more likely."

10. Again, hard to justify in footnotes, but read the whole article. It
is commonly understood to mean "we cannot be *certain* of the future,"
but it cuts far deeper than that.

    > If Hume is right, the belief that the sun will rise tomorrow is as unjustified as the belief that a million mile wide bowl of tulips will appear over the horizon instead. We suppose the second belief is insane.
    > ... 
    > But then the onus is on these defenders of “common 
   sense” to show precisely what is wrong with Hume’s argument. No one has 
   yet succeeded in doing this (or at least no one has succeeded in 
   convincing a majority of philosophers that they have done so).
   
    Also see
   
    > *[Wheeler would] say things like, “In the end, the only law is that
  there is no law.” There’s no ultimate law of physics. All the laws of
  physics are mutable and that mutability itself is a principle of physics. He’d
  say, there’s no law of physics that hasn't been transcended. I saw this, and
  I remembered my joke about how the laws of physics must be wrong, and I was
  immensely attracted to this idea that maybe ultimately there actually are no
  laws of physics. What there is in place of laws, I didn't know. But if the
  laws weren't 100 percent trustworthy, maybe there was a back door to the
  stars.*

11. Sometimes it is argued back that there is no way to know whether
even *you* are conscious. Again, I cannot do it justice here, but I
might as well try. 

    Look and/or listen around you and try to answer, as innocently as 
    possible: doesn't it definitely *seem* as though something is happening? 
    Not probably but *definitely?* Forget about whether it is possible to 
    know what is "actually" happening. 

    This is a different *kind* of certainty than you can have about
    metaphysical hypotheses like space and time. It does not depend
    on reasoning. If you find yourself becoming unsure of this fact, 
    just let go of reasoning for a moment and "look again."
    
    
12. Recall the final part of note 4. As
with any physical system, your entanglement can fall along a spectrum.
If you are asleep when the result reaches you, and your body/brain
states in the two cases are nearly indistinguishable, then the
coherence of the rest of the system (excluding you) is only partially
lost: you can still show *most* of the interference, in principle.

    This naturally leads to the question of whether something like a
    [quantum eraser experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment) should be theoretically possible:
    restoring the cat's superposition by *completely* "forgetting" it.
    This is pure sci-fi today.
    
    
13. Though it should be noted that we *have* done this with at least
trillions of carefully controlled atoms. See, e.g. [here](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2010/mar/18/quantum-effect-spotted-in-a-visible-object).
