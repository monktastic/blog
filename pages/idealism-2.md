Perhaps you have had the intuition that reality is far stranger than it
seems. This feeling can find expression in a multitude of ideas, from
the relatively tame (my brain gives rise to my personal perception
of reality) to the extremely far-fetched (reality is a simulation;
a figment of my imagination; etc.) to many bizarre possibilities
in-between (e.g., that my thoughts can directly influence reality).

It seems hard or impossible to test some of the more extreme
hypotheses, and so most of us give at most a half-hearted attempt to
confirm or deny them before settling back into our default worldview
(most commonly, materialism). We become at best skeptical, or at worst
cynical, about the possibilities they offer.

If this world really *is* entirely a manifestation of your mind, it
should be possible to discover that quite directly. The only thing that
could stop you from seeing it is *you*. But why would you do that? And
how?

These pages aim to give some pointers, in case you feel inspired to
find out.

### Introduction: Radical skepticism

The first and most important thing to see very clearly is how your
current views of reality -- such as the existence of time -- are no
more than a *preference*, not supported by evidence and logic in the
way you normally assume.

It is possible to understand this intellectually and still completely
miss its significance. When it is *grokked*, one cannot help but be
overcome by profound humility and the heartfelt recognition that one
has been taking existence utterly for granted.
