Look around. What you call "physical reality" is actually a dream. It is
possible to ascertain this beyond any reasonable doubt. Unfortunately you are 
currently faced with a chicken-and-egg problem: until you see good evidence for 
this claim, you won't put in enough effort to validate it; on the other hand,
no evidence will be forthcoming while you so strenuously constrain the dream to 
mundanity.

In a nighttime dream, it is possible to wake up *into* the dream (known as
"lucid dreaming"). With considerable practice, it becomes possible to unravel the 
dream like a sweater, discovering very precisely how every little detail is 
constructed.
It is also possible to *reconstruct* the dream as you see fit, and then to fall
back asleep *into* it, mostly forgetting the truth, so that you can be really 
engrossed in the drama. It is a fiendishly clever process.

The same is true for the "waking dream," which is where you find yourself now.
You are the Buddha trying to wake up.

I would be lying if I said I could show you the Full Monty. Nonetheless, I
might be able to at least help you notice the mechanism that keeps you asleep.
Whether you choose to follow up beyond that is up to you.

Your mind is made up of many layers. Near the surface are layers that give rise
to your coarse thoughts, memories, sensations, and personality. Much deeper
layers give rise to your metaphysical beliefs (i.e., beliefs about the nature
of reality), and deeper still, to the behaviors you think of as "physics." 
Notice I use the word "mind," as "brain" refers to an illusory dream object 
(whose behavior you have chosen to closely correlate with mental activity).

The layers that give rise to physics are what religious people call "God."
Until you are fully awake, it can be beneficial to think of this as an entity
distinct from yourself, because those layers are *far* outside your current 
conscious access. Access can be achieved via something that I'm 
perfectly happy to think of as "prayer" (though it scarcely matches the
traditional definition of the word). It involves *releasing* irrational beliefs, 
rather than adopting new ones. There is also an emotional component involved.

The general idea is this: by questioning your beliefs in just the right way,
you can temporarily slice through the illusion. This incision can penetrate
deep layers of mind, allowing for a subtle shift in the dream's dynamics. These
shifts may not be consciously noticeable until they accumulate. Even when they 
become detectable, there's a very high probability that you will write them off 
as totally explainable within your default worldview, which will cause a healing
of those layers, resetting your progress.

If you're serious about this, you'll have to become acutely aware of the knee-jerk
response you have to stuff every little thing into your worldview. It operates
continuously, normally beneath your conscious threshold. It is the same basic
process that operates in a nighttime dream: if a green elephant floats on by,
the mind produces a satisfying explanation ("oh, duh, green elephants always
come by on Zurxday!"). There's obviously much more consistency in this dream, 
but the same principle applies.

Almost nobody has the fortitude to stick with it, as the dream is sufficiently
internally consistent to lull all but the most curious back to sleep. We
will later address the paradox of there being *other people* when this is
entirely your dream. A useful mental model is that this *is* your dream,
and everyone else is the Buddha waiting for you to wake up. Treating Buddha
well will greatly accelerate your progress.

If you could perceive the sense in which **this** is the *first* (and perhaps
*only*) moment of existence, you would be overcome by heartbreaking beauty 
and dazzling glory literally beyond your wildest imagination -- because even
your imagination is constrained by your limited worldview. The immense awe,
wonder, gratitude, and love you would feel constitute a form of prayer, a fact
we will later make use of.

The closest that people normally get is to imagine that it's about "being in the 
now" or some similarly watered-down concept. But even if you accept the radical 
notion that "it's always now," the very concept "now" is only meaningful as a 
dividing line between a future and a past. If you even subtly suspect a future 
and past, then *this* clearly 
isn't the first or only moment. To actually see what the Buddha is pointing to, 
you'll have to transcend that entire conceptual structure.

Scientific theories by definition do not transcend that structure, their key
feature being that they are *conceptually explanatory*. Thus, while you should 
still rejoice in their beauty, recognize that they can never be *transcendent*
in the way we require here.

A good place to start is questioning the past.

---

[We cannot say it is "likely" that the past really happened](past.html).
Similarly, it is not "unlikely" that it all popped into existence just now. 
Take a few moments and reflect deeply on this fact. Take *dead seriously* the 
possibility that you and the world popped into being *now*, and that the past 
is an illusion. Do this until you feel a little bit "tripped out."

There's a chance that you will be unable to feel even a little unusual. For
example, if your mind is busy explaining why there's nothing weird about this,
or why the past being real or fake makes no difference, then chances are you
won't actually bother to *look* in the way I'm prodding you to. It's a bit like
bungee jumping: you can stand arguing on the platform, or you can jump.

Notice that you can still perfectly well remember your own name or what you did 
yesterday. Just because you stop taking the past *literally* doesn't mean that 
you can't use it *functionally*. This is important to see, because one of the 
reasons you insist on taking everything so literally is that you're afraid you 
couldn't function otherwise. This is completely false.

On the flip side, you may see no reason *not* to take things literally: if 
you'll behave the same either way, what difference can it make? But the trippy
feeling you experienced should suggest that there *is* some difference. The 
point is not to feel continually tripped out, but to rediscover a certain
lightness of being that you long ago forgot -- and to *empirically* discover
how that affects the dream.

Now let's do something similar for the future. 

---

[There is no reason to believe that the laws of physics will continue to hold
even one second from now](future.html). It's not "unlikely" that things will
suddenly go haywire in any number of arbitrarily strange ways. Pay careful
attention to how intensely resistant your mind is to that conclusion. It would
much rather deny or dismiss it than confront it squarely. This offers a 
clear window into the process that keeps you asleep.

The rational mind is a gatekeeper. As long as it is certain about something,
we cannot see other possibilities. If you can understand clearly that you have
no reason to trust the past or future, you have permission to stop taking them 
so literally. Nonetheless, you must still walk through the gateless gate.

With a lightness of past and a wide open future, the dream dynamics may begin
to shift. Perhaps unexpected doors open in your life. Some of these shifts can be 
easily explained (e.g., by changes in your behavior). If there are any effects 
which verge on the magical -- that is, that test 
the boundaries of your worldview -- then your faith will be tested. Do you
double down on your irrational (or at least *un*rational) beliefs, insisting 
that there must a "perfectly reasonable" explanation? 

Or do you chase the rabbit down the hole?

---

The idea of chasing the rabbit no doubt strikes you as insane. This fear is
not entirely unfounded: if you were to be exposed to the full truth without
adequate preparation, you may, in fact, [go insane](fear.html). You defend
against this possibility by being unable to take these ideas seriously.

In a nighttime dream, the character walking around *in* the dream may have 
entirely different memories and personality than the one who fell asleep and *is
dreaming*. In one sense, they are different people, but in another sense, they 
are the *same* person. If someone walks up to the dream character and says "you 
are dreaming," it would be wrong for the *character* to interpret this as *she*
is dreaming. The information has to somehow reach the *dreamer*, who is, after
all, the one looking through the character's eyes. In fact, it is the dreamer's
mind that is manifesting as the entire dream -- other characters included. The
dreamer is trying to wake *herself* up via the dream.

Similarly, to properly understand how "you" are dreaming, you must stop
pretending to be the dream character. This is called transcending the ego.

Even the *idea* that you are a dream
character can be unsettling, which is why Buddhism (amongst others) makes such
a strong point to develop qualities of the heart. The dreamer -- Buddha, God,
whatever word you like -- is not another *person*, but *unconditional love
itself*. Thus the *entire dream* is nothing but a manifestation of love --
though it probably doesn't appear that way to the character at present.

---

The character -- you -- feels largely cut off from love. Certainly from
infinite, unconditional love. The very idea is preposterous.
