Why is it that the word "mundane" means both "pertaining to physical reality"
and "tedious; repetitive and boring"? After all, it is certainly quite possible 
to experience physical reality as incredibly beautiful and awe-inspiring.

One possibility is that we hanker for magical experiences; anything that would
rescue us from the shackles of everyday life. Our wishful thinking makes us
dream of a supernatural world, and so the real world is dull by comparison.

But I'd like to offer another possibility: physical reality feels vaguely dull 
and repetitive because you take it far more literally than you are justified
in doing.

The reason that your life does not feel overwhelmingly glorious and infinitely 
wondrous is that you feel a deep-seated certainty that you know, more 
or less, how it all works. In short: reality is a collection of stuff, 
interacting through time and space, according to fixed laws.
Sure, there are a few little details for physicists to iron out, but the basic 
structure is in place and is pretty much incontrovertible.

*This* moment is nothing special because you had one very much like it just a 
moment ago, and a moment before that, in a series of moments stretching back to
your birth. Been there, done that. Because of this, you seek out special 
experiences to spice things up -- a trip to the symphony, or a Michelin starred 
restaurant -- but even those moments differ from previous ones only in a few 
small details: the sound is a little sweeter; the flavor a little richer. On 
rare occasion they briefly transport you to another world: a little taste of 
transcendence before the mental chatter swoops back in and puts a lid on the 
whole affair.

In between these moments of ennui your daily experience is subtly conditioned 
by a veritable smorgasbord of neuroses: regrets, resentments, anxieties, and
fears -- all of which depend, inextricably, on your wholehearted faith in the
fundamental reality of time.

If you could perceive the sense in which **this** is the *first* (and possibly 
*only*) moment of existence, you would be overcome by heartbreaking beauty so 
exquisite that it cannot be imagined -- let alone experienced -- within your 
current cognitive confines.

But this is just the price you pay for being real. Far better to bravely face
up to the facts than to escape to some fantasy world, after all. Time is just 
a brute fact of life, and the best we can hope to do is make peace with it, 
right?

But have you ever stopped to consider *why*, exactly, you are so dead certain
about the nature of time? Has it really earned the undying allegiance
you have so obsequiously pledged it?
