Look around you. If this were all a dream, how would you know it? *Could* you even
know it? Haven't philosophers asked these questions for ages and not come to a
consensus? Doesn't that mean it's pointless or irrelevant for *you* to
investigate them?

Well, this *is* a dream. You *can* know it. And it is *very* relevant for you.
Understanding this can have profound implications for your life.

You're probably feeling something like strong incredulity right now. "He can't
be serious with this Matrix sh*t." That's totally normal and healthy. It's a
defense mechanism your mind employs to avoid taking the steps that would
ultimately provide it with as much evidence as it needs to verify these claims.

So why isn't there any evidence right now? Why hasn't anyone else figured this out? The short answer is that this is ultimately your dream, so evidence will only enter to the degree that you allow it.

By now this is probably sounding a little too convenient. Why don't I believe it? Because there's no evidence. Why isn't there evidence? Because I don't believe it. So, what, I should start believing crazy things in hopes that I will eventually experience crazy things?


Actually, you don't have to adopt any new beliefs. All that is required is to 
disengage the engine that perpetually but misguidedly reinforces your existing 
beliefs. If you were to see
clearly that those beliefs have no rational basis, surely there would be no
objection to relaxing them a bit, right? And yet you'll find that even if you
intellectually understand their lack of basis, that will not convince you *one 
iota* to seriously question them.

Why? Well, can't you already sense where this rabbit hole goes? If this
is all *your* dream, then doesn't that mean you are all alone in the universe?
That it's all been a giant lie? And if even concepts like *time* are illusory,
then doesn't it mean that you're alone and stuck in a lie for all of eternity?
Even if this is true -- *especially* if it's true -- that is not a place that 
your mind will go willingly, to put it extremely mildly. Of all the terrifying
possibilities, that takes the cake.

Luckily it's not quite the truth. While this is indeed "your" dream, "you" does
not mean exactly what you think it does. This fundamental confusion about your
true nature -- sometimes called ego -- is the basis of the unfounded yet intense
fear that causes you not only to generate (and maintain) the dream, but to
ensure that you never seriously consider that you might be doing so.

In reality, the truth is as overwhelmingly beautiful as the lie is terrifying.
It may be a dream, but it is certainly not "just" a dream in any pejorative
sense.

At a more conventional level, the egoic process is what compels you to be a less
generous and more anxious human than you feel you might otherwise be. This
problem is far easier to communicate, which accounts for the Western adoption of
traditions like Buddhism as mere psychological aids. It also makes it easy to
believe that awakening is nothing more than an "optimized brain" or similar,
allowing us to preserve our cherished beliefs about brains, matter, time, space,
....

We never suspect that this desperate preservation attempt is precisely what's
blocking our path to full awakening -- or even our discovery of evidence that
would allow us to take any of this seriously.

This engine of continual belief reinforcement is what is known in Buddhism as
samsara, literally "wandering," -- as though through an endless desert of
despair (with the occasional temporary oasis, of course). Sooner or later we get
tired of wandering and find our way back home.

Though you have the power to conjure realities so fiendishly clever,
internally consistent, and profoundly intricate that they can fool you for a
*very* long while, the one thing you cannot do is be fooled forever. In every
dream you manifest, you always leave a few loose ends: threads of the sweater
which, if pulled sincerely enough, begin to unravel the whole ruse. It is
like climbing into a magical sack and trying to sew it shut from the inside:
a seam will always remain visible.

All I can do is to try and point out some of these seams. It is up to you to 
decide whether they represent genuine inconsistencies worthy of closer 
investigation, or foolish misinterpretations of facts easily explainable by
an entirely mundane world.
