Let's get some things out of the way first.

This dream -- which you could also call "the miracle of life" -- is meant to
be deeply *appreciated and shared*, not merely *transcended*. That this may
*lead* to transcendence is not your concern. If you view the dream as a chore
or obstacle, you can expect to discover that it is one.

Other people are as real as you. And yet this is all your dream. The meaning
of "you" in those two sentences is not the same, but both are accurate in their
own context. If you misunderstand one way, you end up in an entirely mundane
world. If you misunderstand the other way and mistreat people, you can expect
to suffer.

> *The Buddha said to Subhuti, â€œAll great bodhisattvas should subdue
their minds in the following manner: they should realize as they vow
to save all sentient beings that in truth there are no sentient beings
to be saved ..."*

Finally, you may wonder exactly what kind of "evidence" you will discover. Here
I can only say "whatever evidence you need," dodgy though that may seem.
Examples from other people's lives are of little use. If they fall outside of
your world view, you won't believe them, and if they fit inside your world view,
you won't consider them evidence of anything.
