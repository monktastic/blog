Let's get some things out of the way first.

This dream -- which you could also call "the miracle of life" -- is meant to
be deeply *appreciated and shared*, not merely *transcended*. That this may
*lead* to transcendence is not your concern. If you view the dream as a chore
or obstacle, you can expect to discover that it is one. It is a dream, but
you must never think of it as "just" a dream.

Other people are as real as you. Which is to say that the *human* aspects are
not fundamentally real, but you are all Buddha. Treating Buddha poorly is the
most surefire way to stay asleep and suffering, and treating them well will
accelerate your awakening.

<!--
Finally, you may wonder exactly what kind of "evidence" you will discover. Here
I can only say "whatever evidence you need," evasive though that may seem.
Examples from other people's lives are of little use. If they fall *outside* of
your world view, you won't believe them, and if they fit *inside* your world 
view, you won't consider them evidence of anything. On the cutting edge is where
the magic happens, but it is always *your* cutting edge.
-->

This dream is completely your own, and ultimately governed entirely 
by *your* beliefs. This may seem paradoxical: if people around you believe the
same thing, then aren't you constrained by *their* beliefs? I admit I don't
have a complete resolution for you here.
Nonetheless, you should know that worrying about external constraints is the
primary cause of your delusion. You should think of this dream as 
*completely yours*, with all the other Buddhas patiently waiting for *you* to 
wake up.

their minds in the following manner: they should realize as they vow
to save all sentient beings that in truth there are no sentient beings
to be saved ..."*

Finally, do not expect anything to happen overnight. Consider it a good outcome 
if you begin to sense how you keep yourself asleep. On the other hand, you *may*
be of exceptional talent, and it would be a terrible mistake to assume that 
you're not -- regardless of how silly your human form may sometimes seem.

Okay, let's begin.

---

The world [*feels* mundane](mundane.html) because you take it far more literally 
than you ought to. We're going to challenge those beliefs in ways you're not
used to, so strap in.

[We cannot say it is "likely" that the past really happened](past.html).
Similarly, it is not "unlikely" that it all popped into existence just now. 
Take a few moments and reflect deeply on this fact. Take *dead seriously* the 
possibility that you and the world popped into being *now*, and that the past 
is an illusion. Do this until you feel a little bit "tripped out."

There's a chance that you will be unable to feel even a little unusual. For
example, if your mind is busy explaining why there's nothing weird about this,
or why the past being real or fake makes no difference, then chances are you
won't actually bother to *look* in the way I'm prodding you to. It's a bit like
bungee jumping: did you come here to talk or to jump?

Notice that you can still perfectly well remember your own name or what you did 
yesterday. Just because you stop taking the past *literally* doesn't mean that 
you can't use it *functionally*. This is important to see, because one of the 
reasons you insist on taking everything so literally is that you're afraid you 
couldn't function otherwise.

On the flip side, you may see no reason *not* to take things literally: if 
you'll behave the same either way, what difference does it make? But the trippy
feeling you experienced should suggest that there *is* some difference. The 
point is not to feel continually tripped out, but to rediscover a certain
lightness of being that you long ago forgot -- and to *empirically* discover
how that affects the world around you.

---

Now let me do something similar for the future. 
[There is no reason to believe that the laws of physics will continue to hold
even one second from now](future.html). It's not "unlikely" that things will
suddenly go haywire in any number of arbitrarily strange ways. Pay careful
attention to how intensely resistant your mind is to that conclusion, and how
it tries to wriggle out: "fine, there may be no *reason* to believe that things
will continue to operate, but *obviously* they will." This offers a clear window 
into the process that keeps you asleep.

In brief, we continually and powerfully reinforce our beliefs about the nature
of reality, including the belief *that* our beliefs have no bearing on it.
The problem is, you've never actually sliced through your beliefs cleanly
and persistently enough to actually test out that hypothesis. Understanding that 
those beliefs are not justified may give you the confidence to do just that.
When in doubt, ask yourself: which is more crazy, relaxing my unwarranted
beliefs or clutching them desperately?

Again, the point is not to feel tripped out. It is to discover whether your
certainty about the future actually affects it in ways beyond the obvious.
With a lightness of past and a wide open future, your behavior can change in
ways that profoundly affect your surroundings, of course. If it has any effects
which verge on the magical -- that is, that test the boundaries of your 
worldview -- you will be confronted with a choice: do I insist that the mundane
explanation is sufficient, or do I relax and remember that those beliefs are
unjustified?

However you respond, the dream will respond in kind.

> [A]lthough it can be a helpful way of looking for a while to see that “it’s always the present”, that “only Now exists”, or even that “Being is endlessly Now”, such notions reify and sometimes eternalize ‘the now’. Just as with perceptions of flow, eventually the present needs to be seen through also. ‘Being in the now’ is most certainly not the goal of practice. Realizing the emptiness of all time – past, future, and present – is essential to a more radical liberation. Such insight is accessible through a range of means and will ultimately take us even deeper into the mystery of dependent origination.

What does he mean by "a more radical liberation"? It's easy to think of
awakening (or "enlightenment") as being about having a super optimized brain or
something. It would be much harder to conceive of an awakening in which our
normal concepts like brains, time, and space don't even apply.
