Let's get some things out of the way first.

This dream -- which you could also call "the miracle of life" -- is meant to
be deeply *appreciated and shared*, not merely *transcended*. That this may
*lead* to transcendence is not your concern. If you view the dream as a chore
or obstacle, you can expect to discover that it is one.

Other people are as real as you. And yet this is all your dream. The meaning
of "you" in those two sentences is not the same, but both are accurate in their
own context. If you misunderstand one way, you end up in an entirely [mundane
world](mundane.html). If you misunderstand the other way and mistreat people, 
you can expect to suffer. Badly.

their minds in the following manner: they should realize as they vow
to save all sentient beings that in truth there are no sentient beings
to be saved ..."*

Finally, you may wonder exactly what kind of "evidence" you will discover. Here
I can only say "whatever evidence you need," evasive though that may seem.
Examples from other people's lives are of little use. If they fall *outside* of
your world view, you won't believe them, and if they fit *inside* your world 
view, you won't consider them evidence of anything. On the cutting edge is where
the magic happens, but it is always *your* cutting edge.

The most important thing for you to be doing here is watching your mind as you 
read this. The way your mind responds to things is always your biggest clue.

The first thing to see is that you believe in ideas that have
*no logical justification*.

[There is no reason to believe that the past really happened](past.html).

[There is no reason to believe that the laws of physics will continue to hold
in the future](future.html).

This is very tricky to convey, because it will sound to you like I'm trying to 
*disprove* your most precious beliefs, which will cause your mind to lock
down. Once you understand that I am not trying to disprove them, you will think 
"oh, so they are totally justified," but that does not follow, either. **Don't
worry about whether the beliefs are true or false. Notice only the huge
disconnect between the fact that you have *no reason to believe them* and the
fact that you are *dead certain about them anyway***.

What causes this gulf? You may think "it's much more *practical* to
believe," but this runs into two problems. First, you should notice that your
beliefs are *much stronger* than mere "practicality" can account for, and 
second, you haven't ever actually *stopped* believing, so you have no point of
comparison.
