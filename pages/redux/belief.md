> -- Philip K Dick

Perhaps you've noticed that you can't just will away physical reality. This
seems like pretty solid justification for it being real. But this is 
disingenuous: you (currently) lack even the most basic control over your mind,
let alone over the layers that give rise to your metaphysical beliefs (i.e.,
beliefs about the nature of reality).

Have you ever had the experience of reading a book, only to discover that your
eyes are still scanning the page but your mind is elsewhere? If you're
interrupted mid-reverie, chances are you can recall the past few seconds of
thought. Those thoughts were not really *outside* of consciousness and yet,
somehow, you weren't really *noticing* them either.

You very likely spend the vast majority of your day in such a semi-conscious 
state. You may have a hard time believing this, because the mind readily
back-fills a sense of presence even when there was none. It's a little bit
like your [visual blind spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision)): to find it, you have to know how to look.

When you begin to meditate, you see for yourself just how busy your mind is,
in a way that normally escapes your notice. You discover that *most* of your 
thoughts occupy this "conscious but not noticed" limbo.

Once you learn to notice this raging river of thoughts, a lot of your mood and
personality can be understood on a level that is simply not possible otherwise. 
This accounts for the commonly recognized benefits of meditation.

If you decide to progress on the path, this mindlessness starts happening less 
and less. As you become more present, you begin to detect an undercurrent of
ever more subtle thoughts flowing between the big, coarse ones. When even these 
quieten, and you're sitting in a seemingly thought-free state, you might consider 
yourself basically free of thought.

But are you really?

If you still feel like a self sitting in a world of space and time, it's because
there's still a layer of your mind you have not yet penetrated.

This is where most meditators get stuck. It's easy to think that meditation is
about sitting in peaceful stillness, but that's only the start.

If you look *very carefully*, you will discover that you never actually
experience the passage of time. You only ever experience a single moment.
Woven into this moment is a bit of experience that you *infer* to be "the past." 
This inference normally happens so subtly and seamlessly that you scarcely 
notice it.

You could say that it happens subconsciously, but only in the same sense that
mind wandering is subconscious. It's perfectly *accessible* to consciousness;
we just don't have the skills to notice it yet. Because it happens well below
your conscious threshold, it feels like time is happening *to* you, when really
you are *doing* it. You are not passively *experiencing* time; you are actively 
*generating* that illusion.

You are not "continually" generating it, either. You only do it in *this*
moment. You might say that you are born fresh in each moment, but this implies 
that there is a constant "you" moving across time. Instead, it would be more 
accurate to say that *this* is the first (and only) moment you are alive. Now, 
now, now; fresh, fresh, *fresh*.

I cannot convince you of this, and even if 
I could, the intellectual understanding would do you very little good.

Time is not the only inference you are making. When you hear a sound, that
sound is occurring *inside* your mind. Experientially, it happens in exactly the
same place it would if this were a nighttime dream. But you *infer* it to be
coming from outside your mind, and so it *feels* like the sound is happening
outside your mind, "over there." Again, *it only feels like this because your
attention isn't precise enough to catch the trick.*

In reality, all you ever experience is your own mind. Through a rapid series
of subconscious inferences, you project that experience out and think of it as
"the world out there."

Author, meditator, and neuroscientist Culadasa (John Yates) points out:

> By observing the nature of the mind in both its active and passive states, it eventually becomes clear that *all* objects of consciousness are *constructs of the mind*. All we’ve ever known is what the mind itself has produced. The true nature of these mind-made objects of consciousness is simply the nature of mind itself. You may have already grasped this intellectually, but you now experience it directly. True, there may have been some external stimulus that caused your unconscious sub-minds to project a particular object into consciousness, but all we can ever observe is the *mental* object, a *product* of the mind itself—not the source of the original stimulus. To put it another way, the “thing-in-itself” that stimulated the mind to produce the object *can never be observed*. The mind creates its own “reality,” made entirely of cognitive-emotional constructs produced in response to unknown, and ultimately unknowable, forces acting on the mind through the senses.

Look around you. Can you look around and (honestly) recognize: "this is all my 
own mind"?

Culadasa continues:

> It’s especially important not to be deceived by mere intellectual understanding. You may think you “got it” just by reading this description. However, many philosophers and scientists have understood this truth intellectually, but it hasn’t transformed them. We haven’t gotten it until this Insight completely transforms the way we perceive the world—especially during challenging times, like when we’re in an argument with our boss or partner, in a traffic jam, or when our house burns down.


If you want to know what happens when you stop believing, you will have to
penetrate much deeper into the mind than you have.

In the last section we saw that the reality you inhabit is entirely mental. At
this point it's easy to get hung up on the question of whether there's a "real
reality" that's *causing* your mental one. Trying to confront it directly is a
waste of time. A much more productive avenue is to ask "how much freedom do I
have in constructing this one?" 

The more freedom you discover in *this* reality, the less you will be hung up 
on some hypothetical "real reality." On the flip side, the more convinced you 
are of an external reality, the less freedom you'll bother to search for in
this one.

The good news is that you don't have to *disbelieve* in physical reality. That
would, indeed, make you crazy. All you have to do is become aware of the ways
in which your mind

---

At this point you must be wondering: "couldn't it be the case that there
really *is* a world out there, which is causing the whole process you describe?"

Maybe yes, maybe no. But as with time, the important question is not whether
it's true or false, but why you are so strongly attached to the idea.

Whether or not there is an external reality, you do have *some* leeway in how
you construct your own reality. The only question is how much.

In most polite presentations of Buddhism, they tend to tread very lightly here.
Nonetheless, if you read between the lines, you will discover what they are
really trying to say.

> The essence of [Buddhism] can be reduced to a single point: The mind is the source of all experience, and by changing the direction of the mind, we can change the quality of everything we experience. When you transform your mind, everything you experience is transformed.  ...  There are truly no limits to 
  the creativity of your mind.
