Look around you. If this were all a dream, how would you know it? *Could* you 
even know it? Haven't philosophers asked these questions for ages and not come 
to a consensus? Doesn't that mean it's pointless or irrelevant for *you* to
investigate them?

Well, this *is* a dream. You *can* know it beyond any reasonable doubt. 
And it is *very* relevant for you.
Understanding this can have profound implications for your life.

You're probably feeling something like incredulity right now. "He can't
be serious with this Matrix sh*t." That's totally normal and healthy. It's a
defense mechanism your mind employs to avoid taking the steps that would
ultimately provide it with as much evidence as it needs to verify these claims.

What's it defending against? Well, if this is *your* dream, then in some strange 
sense you are responsible for much more than you've realized. It would also seem 
to imply that you're stuck all alone in an infinite lie. That's the stuff of bad
trips and nightmares. Who would want to discover that?

Luckily, that's not *actually* the punchline. No, the truth is *far* stranger, 
and as overwhelmingly beautiful as the lie is terrifying.

Why isn't there any evidence of this? Why hasn't anyone else figured it out or
demonstrated it? Because this is *your* dream, and you allow in precisely as much 
evidence as is necessary for your situation. You are the Buddha dreaming s/he is 
human, and apparently the human doesn't need to know right now. This explanation
seems ludicrous enough to you that it alone would stop you from digging deeper.

So why can't you just change the dream at will? Because the deep layers of
mind that give rise to the dream's dynamics are far beyond your current conscious
access. Additionally, because those dynamics seem to continually reconfirm your 
certainty about the mundanity of the world, you find it hard or ridiculous to
ponder the alternative deeply enough for it to actually demonstrate its truth.

Which seems to put you in a circular bind. You'd need evidence before you'd
bother to develop the skills that would allow you to discover the evidence.... 
Seems like this could go on for a while. Lifetimes, even.

It's what the Buddhists call *samsara*, literally "wandering" -- as though 
through an endless desert of despair. Occasionally you do reveal the full Truth 
to yourself, like an oasis to keep your spirits up. In these moments, you can know
*with certainty* -- a species of certainty that is not born of the dream -- that 
all I've said is true. But until it's time to fully awaken, you must leave the
oasis and wander on, with at best a strange and fast-fading memory that nobody 
would believe.

Why do you put yourself through all this? [To learn](www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html).
The Game wouldn't be very much fun if you woke up too quickly, now would
it? Nor would it be so cool if you remained asleep forever. Luckily, being 
all-powerful, you planned for these eventualities. You planted ideas like God,
Buddha, and Unconditional Love, which, if followed to their essence with complete 
sincerity, would draw back the curtains. Failing that, you could simply "turn 
the light around" and seek the source of the mysterious phenomenon you call 
"consciousness." If even that is too esoteric, you've left yourself purely 
rational clues that can help you bootstrap the process.

Though you have the power to conjure realities so fiendishly clever,
internally consistent, and profoundly intricate that they can fool you for a
*very* long while, the one thing you cannot do is be fooled forever. In every
dream you manifest, you always leave a few loose ends: threads of the sweater
which, if pulled sincerely enough, begin to unravel the whole ruse. It is
like climbing into a magical sack and sewing it shut from the inside:
a seam will always remain visible.

All I can do is to try and point out some of these seams. It is up to you to 
decide whether they represent genuine inconsistencies worthy of closer 
investigation, or foolish misinterpretations of facts easily explainable by
an entirely mundane world.

 For example, you've dreamt up people like the
Buddha or Jesus who supposedly Knew, but they play very minor roles in your
dream right now, filed away for safekeeping. In truth, *you* are the Buddha;
The One Who Dreams. You always have been.
