Look around you. If this were all a dream, how would you know it? *Could* you even
know it? Haven't philosophers asked these questions for ages and not come to a
consensus? Doesn't that mean it's pointless or irrelevant for *you* to
investigate them?

Well, this *is* a dream. You *can* know it. And it is *very* relevant for you.
Understanding this can have profound implications for your life.

You're probably feeling something like strong incredulity right now. "He can't
be serious with this Matrix sh*t." That's totally normal and healthy. It's a
defense mechanism your mind employs to avoid taking the steps that would
ultimately provide it with as much evidence as it needs to verify these claims.

What's it defending against? Your discovering something that you're *unspeakably
terrified* of.

Why is it terrifying? Because you've profoundly misunderstood who you are.
Given your current illusion of identity, this rabbit hole seems to lead somewhere 
deeply unpleasant. Are you a mad God, trapped all alone in an eternal lie? No, the 
truth is *far* stranger, and is as overwhelmingly beautiful as the lie is 
terrifying.

Why isn't there any evidence of this? Why hasn't anyone else figured it out?
Because this is *your* dream, and you allow in precisely as much evidence as is
necessary for your situation. For example, you've dreamt up people like the
Buddha or Jesus who supposedly Knew, but they play very minor roles in your
dream right now, filed away for safekeeping. In truth, *you* are the Buddha;
The One Who Dreams. You always have been.

Then why can't you just change the dream at will? Because in your current form,
your beliefs go *far* deeper than you have conscious access to. Nothing 
prevents you from developing the necessary awareness, either. You're just too 
busy interacting with the dream at face value, like a dog barking at a mirror. 
You will continue to do so until you feel you have enough evidence to 
investigate these claims seriously.

Which seems to put you in a circular bind. You need evidence before you develop 
the skills that would allow you to discover the evidence.... Seems like this
could go on for a while. Lifetimes, even.

It's what the Buddhists call *samsara*, literally "wandering" -- as though through
an endless desert of despair. From time to time you reveal the full Truth to 
yourself, like an oasis meant to keep you going. In these moments, you can know
*with certainty* -- a kind of certainty that makes no sense from within the dream 
-- that all I've said is true. But until it's time to fully awaken, you must 
continue on, with at best a strange and fast-fading memory that nobody would 
believe. Your dream even contains all the tools you need to doubt it (you call 
them "misfiring neurons"). That's what makes it such a good dream.

Why do you put yourself through all this? [To learn](www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html).
The Game wouldn't be very much fun if you woke up too quickly, now would
it? Nor would it be so cool if you remained asleep forever. Luckily, being 
all-powerful, you planned for these eventualities. You planted ideas like God,
Buddha, and Universal Love, which, if followed to their essence with complete 
sincerity, would draw back the curtains. Failing that, you could simply "turn 
the light around" and seek the source of the mysterious phenomenon you call 
"consciousness." If even that is too esoteric, there are still purely rational 
cues that would help you bootstrap the process.

Though you have the power to conjure realities so fiendishly clever,
internally consistent, and profoundly intricate that they can fool you for a
*very* long while, the one thing you cannot do is be fooled forever. In every
dream you manifest, you always leave a few loose ends: threads of the sweater
which, if pulled sincerely enough, begin to unravel the whole ruse. It is
like climbing into a magical sack and trying to sew it shut from the inside:
a seam will always remain visible.

All I can do is to try and point out some of these seams. It is up to you to 
decide whether they represent genuine inconsistencies worthy of closer 
investigation, or foolish misinterpretations of facts easily explainable by
an entirely mundane world.
