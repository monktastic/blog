I want to invite you into a different way of seeing things. You don't have to
adopt any new beliefs, though your existing beliefs may change as a result of
accumulating evidence.

You *will* have to confront some of your most precious existing beliefs. At
first this will seem utterly absurd, even though I can show you that these
beliefs are completely unjustified.


You are certain about a great many things that you have *no reason* to be 
certain of.

I want you to discover what happens when you stop being so sure of them.

You think that *not* believing them would be crazy, because then you would
have to believe their opposites.
