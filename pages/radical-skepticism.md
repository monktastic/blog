## Summary

It is not possible to prove that the past really happened. We cannot
even say that it "probably" happened without making assumptions that
can only be justified through circular reasoning. Ultimately, our
decision to believe in time is *pure preference*.


## Unpacked

Young earth creationists believe that the earth was created in the past
ten thousand years. The neo-creationist Omphalos Hypothesis explains
that dinosaur bones and other seemingly old artifacts might have been
planted there recently by God as a test of our faith.

As ludicrous as this may strike you, there is no logical contradiction
in it. In fact, there is no way to disprove that the universe sprang
into existence, fully-formed, last Thursday. The
mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell took it one step further:

> "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past."

Taken to its logical limit, this may all have appeared freshly in *this*
very moment, the past being nothing but an illusion. You can even
apply that reasoning now. Or now. Or now. Perhaps you never actually
read the above paragraphs, but just popped into existence with the
memory of having done so.

But while such a claim is not logically *impossible*, it is certainly
very *improbable*. Right?

Well, stop for a moment and consider how you might evaluate such a
probability. Suppose you have two models to choose from: one in which
everything suddenly appeared exactly as it is now (let's call this the
Russell metaphysics), and the other is the default model of materialism.
What evidence will you use to decide in favor of one or the other?

A moment's thought will reveal that any facts gleaned from the world
are fully compatible with either model. As such, they should not bias
you toward believing in one or the other. As an example, suppose you are
trying to determine whether an unseen coin is a nickel or a quarter. If
you are told that it was flipped and came up heads, this shouldn't cause
you to favor either answer. Even if you were told the results of one
thousand tosses, you still have learned nothing. You need evidence that
*differs* in the two cases, and we've purposely constructed Russell to
be *identical* in all appearances to materialism.

Okay, so all physical evidence is out. You could try to argue that on
theoretical grounds, it's absurdly unlikely for such a complex world to
spring into existence from nowhere. But this involves circular
reasoning: it *presupposes* that what we know about the world is true.

You may try to use Occam's Razor to make a case, but again you must be
careful. If your argument relies on anything from the past -- such as
evidence suggesting that simpler models tend to be correct -- then
you are again *assuming* your metaphysics in order to prove it. You may
use Occam's Razor in its aesthetic form (namely, that simpler models are
more beautiful and thus preferable), but then you are not stating a
*probability* but a *preference*.

No matter how you slice it, the only way you can say it is "likely" that
the past really happened is by making assumptions that can only be
justified through circular reasoning. Ultimately, your decision to
believe in time is *pure preference*.

Nonetheless, it is such an incredibly *strong* preference that it may
be hard to recognize as one. Such a conclusion is uncomfortable, and
this discomfort is good enough reason to believe in time -- logic be
damned. Russell:

> “Skepticism, while **logically impeccable**, is **psychologically
impossible**, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any
philosophy which pretends to accept it.”

Same with David Hume (whose brilliant Problem of Induction similarly
refutes the rationality of using the past to make any predictions about
the future):

> "Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument which
I have been to such pains to inculcate, whether I be really one of those
skeptics who hold that everything is uncertain, I should reply that
neither I nor any other person was ever sincerely and constantly of
that opinion. I dine, I play backgammon, I converse and am merry with
my friends and when after three or four hours of amusement I would return
to these speculations, they appear so cold and strange and ridiculous
that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any further. Thus the
skeptic still continues to reason and believe, though he asserts he
**cannot defend his reason by reason.**"

And finally, modern physicist Sean Carroll:

> “There is **no way** to distinguish between the scenarios by
collecting new data.
>
> What we’re left with is our choice of prior credences. We’re allowed
to pick priors however we want—and every possibility should get some
nonzero number. But it’s okay to set our prior credence in radically
skeptical scenarios at very low values, and attach higher prior credence
to the straightforwardly realistic possibilities.
>
> Radical skepticism is less useful to us; it gives us no way to go
through life. All of our purported knowledge, and all of our goals and
aspirations, might very well be tricks being played on us. But what
then? We cannot actually act on such a belief, since any act we might
think is reasonable would have been suggested to us by that annoying
demon. Whereas, if we take the world roughly at face value, we have a
way of moving forward. There are things we want to do, questions we
want to answer, and strategies for making them happen. **We have every
right to give high credence to views of the world that are productive
and fruitful, in preference to those that would leave us paralyzed
with ennui.**”

In other words: since there is no logical justification for preferring
one view over the other, we should just pick whichever is productive
and comforting. Actually, without trusting the past and future, we
cannot even confirm that our view is *productive*. What that leaves us
with is that *we should believe in the past because it is comforting*.

Pause for a moment to appreciate this. Is your past really so
comforting?

Now I want to call your attention to the gaping chasm between
understanding this point intellectually, and what you feel in your gut.
You may *understand* that you have no reason to believe in time, but
don't you nevertheless *feel* viscerally certain about it -- far beyond
what can be attributed to mere convenience? What gives rise to this
discrepancy?

How about this: having an accurate model of reality confers evolutionary
fitness, and since time and space really do exist, our reptilian brain
has evolved to model things this way. Our higher brain can't help it!

And in the snap of a finger, your faith in the model is restored, even
though we *just* saw why this is illogical. This remarkable self-healing
property of your worldview should make you a little suspicious, and if
it doesn't, then *that* should give you pause.

*Reality is what remains when you stop believing. But there are some
things you can't stop believing. And anyway if you tried it would be
boring and pointless. Hey, remember that time we were mistreated?*

This series is about how it is possible to have a *functional* belief
in physical reality without taking it *literally*, and why this may be a
very good thing.
