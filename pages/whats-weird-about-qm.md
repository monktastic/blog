Everyone knows that QM is weird, but people are often confused about why,
exactly, it's weird. I want to show you one way in which people think it's
weird when it's really not, and another in which people think it's not but it
really is. It relates to consciousness, but perhaps not in the way you think.

### Superposition and interference

In a typical quantum thought experiment, we have something like a single
particle that could be in one state or another (for example, spin up vs spin
down; moving left vs moving right; going through one slit or another). The
weird thing about QM is that the particle can also, in some sense, be in *both*
states at once. But how do we know this, and what does it mean?
We cannot give a precise explanation without math, so let us give a rough one
in words.

When we measure a particle's spin, we have to pick an axis (x, y, or z). When
we measure it along our chosen axis, it comes out either *up* or *down.* Now
let's say we've just measured our particle along the **x** axis and it came out
*up*. We know (from experiment) that if we then measure that particle along the
**y** axis, it will have a precisely 50-50 chance of coming out *up* vs *down.*
If the **x** axis result had been *down*, the same would be true: measuring it
along **y** would result in *up* half the time and *down* half the time. In
brief: once we have measured it along the **x** axis, then no matter what the
result, it will have a 50-50 chance of coming out *up* vs *down* in the **y**
axis.

It's also possible to *change* the spin of a particle. For example, I can *make*
the particle be *up* in the x direction. If I do that, then you know that
measuring it in the y direction will result in 50-50 odds of up vs down.

So now suppose I flip a coin and say "if it lands heads, I will prepare this
particle to be x-up, and if tails, I will set it to x-down." Now I hand you the
coin and ask you to guess its result in the y-direction. What do you do?

Using simple reasoning, you say "well, in *either* case, we know that measuring
in the y direction should yield a 50-50 outcome; therefore, the result will be
random." And this reasoning is correct. So here we have a particle that has
50-50 odds of up vs down in the x axis, as well as 50-50 odds in the y axis.
There's nothing weird about this. But in quantum mechanics, we can also create
special kinds of states called *superpositions.*

In one kind of superposition, the particle will yield a 50-50 result in the
x-axis, but it will *always* yield up if measured (only) along the y axis.
This shouldn't be possible according to the previous reasoning. If 50-50 in
the x-axis means "it is *either* up *or* down," then we ought to be able to
reason about each case individually, and combine the results: "if it is *up*
in x then ...; if it is *down* in x then ...; therefore ...."

The reason we can't is because it's *not* an either-or thing. It is, in some
sense, in a *combination* of those states. These two states are said to
"interfere" with each other to produce an outcome that neither one could alone.
And this is the hallmark of a superposition state: there is some
*interference experiment* to show that it's not in a classical mixture of 
possibilities.

This may seem weird, but we're just getting warmed up.

### Entanglement

Suppose that we have a second particle that can measure the
