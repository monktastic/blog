### Summary

There is no way to know if anyone else is conscious.

> Solipsism (/ˈsɒlɪpsɪzəm/; *from Latin solus, meaning 'alone', and ipse,
 meaning 'self') is the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is
 sure to exist.*

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism)

> *While no great philosopher has explicitly espoused solipsism, this can
be attributed to the inconsistency of much philosophical reasoning. Many
philosophers have failed to accept the logical consequences of their own
most fundamental commitments and preconceptions.*

It is in principle impossible to know whether anyone else is conscious. It is
impossible to know even whether anything exists beyond your own mind. The
world could all just be your projection. This inconclusiveness is
not a technological or scientific limitation. It cannot be resolved with more
data.

Common
criticisms tend to be along the lines of "but this world is more complex than
anything I can imagine." This is trivially countered: it is commonly the
case that your nighttime dreams are more complex than your dream character
believes he or she could produce. The dream character's perspective is
arising from the same mental source that gives rise to the dream, regardless
of whether the character's supposed mental faculties are dim or sharp.

If you cannot even be sure that other people *exist*, how can you be sure
that they are *conscious?*
