I want to share with you one way that you might meet God -- or at least, a
perspective on reality that might as well be called "God." It doesn't require
that you adopt any new beliefs, but only that you question your existing ones.
Doing that is what the mind likes least, so be prepared for some internal
conflict.

First, it is important to understand *intellectually* that everything you see
(and hear, and taste, and feel, ...) is *inside* your own mind. Pick a sound
and listen to it. That experience you call "sound" is happening within your
own mind. To be more poetic, we could say that *the intrinsic luminosity of
your mind is manifesting as that sound*. Take a moment and really notice this.
Now notice it for your other senses. What you experience as "the world" is, in
fact, your own mind. Look around and say out loud: "*this* is my mind."

At first, it will be hard to take this perspective without overlaying the idea
that this is all happening inside your *brain*. Then "luminosity" must refer 
to something like *neurons firing.* I won't try to convince you that any of this
is *false.* The important thing to notice is that it's almost impossible
to experience a sound without also experiencing your merry band of metaphysical
beliefs (i.e., beliefs about the nature of reality).

You never just *hear a sound*. Simultaneously, you also (subtly) think "it is
caused by X, it is approximately at distance Y, the sound is coming in through
my ears, ...." These thoughts have practical value, but you don't take them only
*practically.* You take them *literally*. Thus, everything you experience is
filtered through your metaphysics. Something interesting happens when you
*stop* interpreting everything through your worldview.

If your only reason to *stop* is to have a cool experience, then you will miss
the point. Some part of your mind will still be latched on, "knowing" that it
is right, hoping to lurk just out of sight so that it can get in on the fun. 
Thus it is *critical* for your intellect to confront the fact that it really, 
well and truly, might be terribly wrong about its most cherished beliefs. Then 
it can serve its *practical* role without also mangling your experience in the 
process.

[There is no reason to believe that the past really happened](past.html)

[There is no reason to believe that the "laws of physics" will hold in the future](future.html)

[There is no reason to believe in an external reality](solipsism.html)

[These beliefs are *preferences*](emotional.html)

If you think I am trying to convince you that time and objective reality are
*not* real, then your mind will put up a vicious fight. But I am not trying
to give you new beliefs; you simply need to be *very honest* with yourself and
see very clearly that your existing beliefs are not rooted in *reason*, but 
*emotion.* It is not enough to understand this in the abstract, either: you 
must face it very squarely -- until your sense of reality begins to falter.

If that sounds scary or crazy, you are on the right track. Your very conception
of who you are depends intimately on your belief structure, so when *that* is
threatened, *you* feel threatened. But which is crazier: *relaxing* a belief 
that you've discovered to be unjustified, or clutching onto it for dear life?

In any case, the fear results from a misunderstanding.

Whose mind is this world occurring in? We just said it is *yours*, but who are
you?

In a nighttime dream, you embody a character who may be arbitrarily different
from your waking self. And yet, in another sense, she *is* you: if she were to
[trace her thoughts back](find-the-dreamer.html) toward the apparent void from 
which they arise -- in the
direction she experiences as "I" -- she would discover *you*. Or rather, you
would rediscover yourself. In one sense, she is right to say "this dream isn't
*my* mind," but in another sense, she's wrong.

Look around again. Whose mind is *this?* It is yours, but not necessarily "you"
as in the dream character you normally take yourself to be. Again, seeing what
I'm pointing to does not require you to *believe* anything. You simply need to
*release* any unjustified certainty you have about the similarity between
the *dreamer* and the *character*. You already have lots of precedent for 
those two being different, and reasoning that should undermine any certainty.

---

If you confront all of the above very honestly and directly, you may begin to
see the world with fresh eyes. You will discover that you've been surrounded by
remarkable splendor and glory that ought not to be possible from within your 
old worldview. Your entire relationship with it will start to shift. 

By no longer constraining the dream with your metaphysics, it may reveal
aspects of itself that have thus far been hidden.
