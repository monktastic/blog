You are currently engulfed in a glory beyond your wildest dreams, but for some
reason, you don't notice it. I'm going to try to give some hints on how to
recognize it for yourself.

## Part 1: The Light

First, close your eyes and listen to a sound. For me, it's the sound of traffic
in Manhattan. Now try to answer: what is that sound *made of?*

You might be tempted to say it's made of vibrating air molecules, but notice
that you can experience exactly the same sound in a dream, where there is no
real air. What we're really wondering is, what is the *experience itself* made
of? Listen very precisely, as though putting it under a microscope. What is its
*fabric*?

It's not clear that this question has a meaningful answer, but I want you to
try to perceive it in the following way: it is the **light of your own mind**,
manifesting as sound. Your mind is a space with the latent *potential* for
experience, and this potentiality manifests as a kind of *luminosity*, taking
form as particular experiences. Really stop and get a feel for this perspective.
Experience sound as an energetic mental phenomenon shining forth from the dark
background of silence.

Got it?

You don't have to take any of this *literally*. I'm not saying that there's a
literal light or energy anywhere. I'm just establishing a vocabulary to help
point you at something.

Now notice that it's not just sound, but *all* of your sensory fields, that are
manifestations of this light. Look at an object, and compare it to darkness.
Can you get a sense that your mind's light is taking form *as* that visual
object? Check this out for taste, smell, and touch as well.

Next, notice how all of your thoughts, emotions, and memories are it, too.
This may be a bit harder to see, since our thoughts tend to be too rapid and
slippery to put them under the microscope. It may help to intentionally think a
thought "loudly" to get a closer look.

If you do this investigation exhaustively, you will discover that everything
you've ever called "the world" has been constituted of this light. It is all
you ever *have* experienced, and all you ever *could* experience -- itself
being the very *essence* of experience.

It is one thing to *understand* this point, and another to directly *perceive* 
it. The two are worlds apart. It is easy enough to think "*obviously* I can only
experience what's happening in my brain," but notice I never said anything 
about a brain. Forget about brains and other explanations, and stare directly 
into the light.

This brings us to....

## Part 2: Radical Skepticism

Radical skepticism is the philosophical position that says that it's impossible
to be certain about anything.

For example, it is impossible to know whether the past really happened, or
whether the universe sprang into being, fully formed, just now. Worse yet, it
is not even possible to conclude that either option is *more likely*. One can
similarly dissolve trust in the future, or physical reality as a whole. For all
you can ever know, this is all a crazy dream.

It is very important to understand here that we're not just saying "it is
impossible to know *for sure*." It is not even possible to decide which is
*more likely* (a real physical reality, the dream hypothesis, or some other
weird option). Any attempt to assign probabilities ends up baking in
assumptions that presuppose the conclusion.

We do not believe in physical reality because it is more *likely*, but because
the other options make it impossible to actually get on with life. This is a
*practical* decision. As a result, radical skepticism is generally regarded as 
quite useless (outside of getting high with your buddies and trying to sound 
deep)-- but it *can* deliver a knockout blow if wielded properly. I'm going to 
try to show you how to do that.

The process goes something like this:

1. Notice, as thoroughly and precisely as possible, that what you call "the 
world" is made entirely of the light of your own field-of-experience.

1. Ask yourself: what is *causing* the light?

1. Notice that you have *no reason* to believe the answer, *whatever it is*.

It is **very hard** to do this precisely. You will very likely answer "my brain"
for (2), and then even if you can consciously admit that there's no reason to 
trust this answer -- which itself is a great accomplishment -- part of you will 
still be utterly convinced of it anyway. This deep-seated conviction will 
occlude the "aha!" moment we're looking for.

> *Most of us suspect we donâ€™t really know what life is. But really **knowing** 
you don't know takes some work. It requires you to clearly see that your story 
is just a story; and to become conscious of the deep mystery at its foundation.*

> -- Tim Freke

Meditation isn't just about relaxing your mind of its mundane concerns. It's
ultimately about relieving it of the insidious illusion that is has any idea
what's really going on.

It is fairly useless to simply *imagine* the result. "What would it be like to 
discover that I can't know what's causing this light? It might be pretty cool, 
I guess. Oooh, aahh. Now what's for dinner?"

Seeing it for real, on the other hand, feels like rediscovering the purpose of
life. Like coming home to a timeless place you never really left, yet missed
terribly. The light is existence; the light is life. For the first time in your 
life, you are not taking it for granted. Overwhelming gratitude, wonder, awe, 
joy, and love beyond what should be possible. Perhaps some insight into the 
origins of religion and the G-word. And more that is probably not useful to 
share here.

You are the Light. You always were. And now the Light is waking up to itself.

What good is such a realization? After all, the aforementioned peak experience
is generally very short-lived.

There are many ways to answer that question, but one straightforward answer is
that it puts the rest of life into context. It becomes easier to see that no
matter what we're going through, the fact that we're going through *anything at
all* is precious beyond belief. It is possible to recognize this without having 
a "mystical experience," but bereft of the above insight, we will *always* take 
existence for granted in various subtle ways.

It's not very useful to try and convince you to seek this realization yourself. 
But if this "spirituality" thing is already an interest of yours, hopefully 
this gives you one more avenue to explore.
