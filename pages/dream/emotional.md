Let's break this down a bit. Suppose you are trying to determine whether an
unseen coin is a penny or a quarter. If you are told that it was flipped and 
came up heads, this shouldn't cause you to favor either answer. Even if you 
were told the results of one thousand tosses, you still have learned nothing.
You would need some evidence that could *differentiate* the cases (such as the
weight of the coin). 

Similarly, a "picture from yesterday" might be evidence of a real past, or it
may have been planted there just now. Since it fits perfectly into either
scenario, it cannot distinguish them. Therefore, as Carroll says, "there is no
way to distinguish between the scenarios by collecting new data." No evidence
can tell a real past from a fake one.

Suppose you *strongly believe* that the coin is a quarter. If you didn't form
this belief from *evidence*, where did this bias come from? It can only come 
from your "prior credence" (a technical term in
[Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics)). 
In other words, if you can't rely on evidence, you should feel free to say 
"well I just *assume* it is a quarter, because otherwise I'd be paralyzed with 
ennui!" or "a real past is more likely because WTF."

Notice that once you've done this, every bit of evidence *seems* to justify
your assumption. "Oh, it came up heads? That's exactly what a quarter
would do! It came up heads a *thousand times?* Now we can be *totally* sure!" 
Similarly, "this picture is *obviously* evidence of a real past." It's not, but
it's very easy to overlook that fact.
