> *"I am awake"* -- The Buddha

---

Look around. What you call "physical reality" is actually a dream. Contrary to
contemporary understanding, it *is* possible to ascertain this beyond any doubt. 
The chief obstacle is a sort of chicken-and-egg problem: until you see good
evidence for the claim, you won't put in enough effort to validate it; on the
other hand, no such evidence will be forthcoming while you remain perpetually
engaged in a subconscious effort to constrain the dream to apparent normalcy. 
Ironically, this effort succeeds precisely *because* it is your dream.

In a nighttime dream, it is possible to wake up *into* the dream (known as
*lucid dreaming*). With considerable practice, it becomes possible to unravel
the dream like a sweater, discovering very precisely how *every little detail*
is constructed. It is also possible to *reconstruct* the dream as you see fit,
and then to fall back asleep *into* it, mostly forgetting the truth, so that you
can become convincingly engrossed in the drama. The fiendish cleverness of this
process is impossible to convey.

All of this applies equally to the "waking dream," though on a *much* grander 
scale. Asleep in that dream is where you find yourself now. You are the Buddha 
trying to remember how to wake up, but mostly looking in all the wrong places.

I would be lying if I said I could show you the Full Monty. Nonetheless, I
might be able to at least help you begin to suspect the mechanism that keeps 
you asleep. Whether you choose to follow up beyond that is up to you.

The mind is made up of layers. Layers near the surface give rise to your
thoughts, memories, personality, and everything you conventionally think of as
yourself. Layers further down give rise to your metaphysical beliefs (i.e.,
beliefs about the nature of reality), and deeper still, to the behaviors you
know of as "physics."

Notice I say "mind" and not "brain." The mind is what is most intimate to you;
your direct, unmediated field of experience. The brain is an illusory dream
object that is useful for scapegoating: "I'm not doing this; my brain is." That
has its place, but it will prevent you from seeing how you are creating all of
this.

The deepest layers are close to what mystics might call "God." Because they are
so far beyond your current conscious access, it can indeed be useful to think of
this as an entity distinct from yourself. From that perspective, some of what I 
suggest may be thought of as "prayer," though perhaps not in the conventional
sense. It involves *releasing* irrational beliefs, not adding new ones.

By radically undermining your beliefs, the dynamics of the dream may shift in
subtle ways that begin to reveal its true nature. This may take considerable 
persistence.

If you could perceive the sense in which **this** is the *first* (and perhaps
*only*) moment of existence, you would be overcome by a sense of gratitude and 
glory literally beyond your wildest imagination -- because even your imagination 
is constrained by your beliefs. The awe, gratitude, wonder, and love you would
feel constitute a form of prayer. You might also think of it as "seeing God's
face."

People commonly try to approximate this as "being in the now" or some similarly 
conventional concept. But even if you accept the radical notion that 
["it's always now"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3JzcCviNDk),
the very concept "now" is only meaningful as a dividing line between a future 
and a past. And if you even subtly suspect a future and past, then *this* 
clearly isn't the first or only moment. To actually see what the Buddha is 
pointing to, you will have to 
[transcend that entire conceptual structure](now.html).

---

There is no way to be sure that the past really happened. Harder to understand
is that [it's not even "likely" that it did](past.html).

Similarly, it is not "unlikely" that it all popped into existence just now. 
Take a few moments and reflect deeply on this fact. Take *dead seriously* the 
possibility that you and the world popped into being *now*, and that the past 
is an illusion. Do this until you feel a little bit "tripped out."

Notice that you can still perfectly well remember your own name or what you did 
yesterday. Just because you stop taking the past *literally* doesn't mean that 
you can't use it *functionally*. This is important to see, because one of the 
reasons you insist on taking everything so literally is that you're afraid you 
couldn't function otherwise. This is false.

On the flip side, you may see no reason *not* to take it literally: if you'll 
behave the same either way, what difference can it make? But the trippy
feeling you experienced demonstrates that there *is* some difference.
The point is not to feel continually tripped out, nor to parade around a new 
belief like "the past is an illusion," but to rediscover a certain lightness of 
being -- and to *empirically* discover how that affects the dream.

Now let's do something similar for the future. 

---

[There is no reason to believe that the laws of physics will continue to hold
even one second from now](future.html). It's not "unlikely" that things will
suddenly go haywire in any number of arbitrarily strange ways.

A normal response is "so what?" It's not like you can *do* anything with that
fact, right? You might as well continue behaving as though things will keep
unfolding normally.

But there *is* something you could try. You could deeply release all your
regrets, resentments, fears, and anxieties, knowing that in a strange but
meaningful sense they are not justified. You could relax your certainties about
how people will behave and how situations will unfold. Even from a conventional 
perspective, this ought to change the course of the dream, but normally there's
still a layer of mind operating that *knows* that what's happening "in here"
cannot directly affect what's "out there."

I invite you to slice through all such certainties. There is no need to replace
them with magical beliefs. This can all be discovered through evidence.

These ideas may strike you as crazy, and if so, it is probably for good reason. 
If you were to be exposed to the full truth without adequate preparation, you 
may, in fact, [go insane](insanity.html). This results from a misunderstanding of
who you are.

In a nighttime dream, you embody a dream character who may be very different
from your waking self. In one sense, the character would be right to say "I am
not the dreamer." But in another sense, he *is*: if he were to trace his 
thoughts back to their source -- in the direction he knows as "I" -- he would 
discover *you*, the dreamer. Or rather, you would rediscover yourself. The
contents of the dream are not *his* mind, but *yours*.

In the same way, you will rightly protest that *you* are not nearly clever 
enough to generate such an internally consistent world as this. And yet, that 
which *is* clever enough is closer to you than your own face. It is precisely
[that which you know as "I"](find-the-dreamer.html). You continually overlook
it, being focused exclusively on your character and her surroundings.

Discovering who you really are is sometimes called *transcending the ego*.

---

Transcending the ego is not about being a nice person, though kindness will, in
fact, greatly speed up the process. It's not that helping others will win you
points with God or karma, but doing so is a good indication that you're 
beginning to realize the sense in which everybody else is also *you*.

One way to see this is to notice that [what you call "the world" is made
entirely of your own mind](nature-of-mind.html). It's true that there *may*
be a "real world" causing it, but *this* (look around you) is all your own mind.
The more precisely you realize this, the less you will worry about some 
hypothetical and unfalsifiable "real world" distinct from *this* place.
This can only be realized through practice; intellectual understanding can only
get you started.

When we say it is "your" mind, we are not talking about *you the dream
character*. As with the nighttime dream, the "you" whose mind this is need not
have anything in common with the character. Both *your* dream character and
all other people are, ultimately, Buddha's mind. So is the rest of "the world."
And yet, as we saw, it is also correct to say that it is *your* mind. But it
is crucial to interpret that phrase correctly, so that you neither go crazy
nor harm other people.

---

An important technique that can speed up (safe) recognition of the dreamlike
nature is *unconditional love.* The more you try to distance yourself from
elements of the dream, the harder it will be for you to recognize them as
part of "your" own mind.

Find someone who you think is undeserving of your love. It's easy to love
"victims," so find a "perpetrator." Against your better judgement, find a way
to love them unconditionally. Part of you recognizes that they would be
happier, and much less harmful, if they were free of deep wounds that are
often invisible to us (and often, even to them, resulting in defiance that
makes them all the harder to love). Nonetheless, such reasoning often strikes 
us as naive and unrealistic, so you may have to come up with your own.

Extend profound forgiveness to someone in your life. This will be hard as hell,
but if it were easy, you would already be awake. It's best to start small.
Find something tiny to forgive, and forgive it more thoroughly than you
otherwise might. Forgive it to the point where you no longer see it as a flaw
in the other person.

* Feel [profound gratitude](radical-gratitude.html) in a situation where you're 
tempted to feel resentment or obligation.

* Feel [deep self-compassion](radical-self-love.html) where you would normally 
beat yourself up.
 
* Feel total camaraderie with a political opponent.

* Etc.

Do these things when you *least* feel like it; when they seem *most* radical.
Ideally, you should do them continuously. By doing so, you may begin to detect 
how apparently external problems are closely mirrored by "internal" processes. 
Allow for the strange possibility that healing one might heal the other and 
see where that takes you.

And remember that *loving* people doesn't preclude your taking appropriate 
action against them -- whether in the form of protesting, or imprisoning,
or potentially even harming, if necessary. In fact, you are much *more* likely
to be confident in your actions when you know they come from the right place.

---

There's not much more for me to share right now. The rest you will have to do
by yourself (or with friends and mentors). Remember, most of all, that it would
be foolish to take the world around you as evidence that it is *not* a dream.
