> *"I am awake"* -- The Buddha

---

Look around. What you call "physical reality" is actually a dream. Contrary to
contemporary understanding, it *is* possible to ascertain this beyond any doubt.
The chief obstacle is a sort of chicken-and-egg problem: until you see good
evidence for the claim, you won't put in enough effort to validate it; on the
other hand, almost no evidence will be forthcoming because you are perpetually
engaged in an effort to constrain the dream to apparent normalcy. Ironically,
this effort succeeds precisely *because* it is your dream.

In a nighttime dream, it is possible to wake up *into* the dream (known as
*lucid dreaming*). With considerable practice, it becomes possible to unravel
the dream like a sweater, discovering very precisely how *every little detail* 
is constructed. It is also possible to *reconstruct* the dream as you see fit,
and then to fall back asleep *into* it, mostly forgetting the truth, so that you
can become deeply engrossed in the drama. The fiendish cleverness of this
process is impossible to communicate.

The same goes for the "waking dream," but on a *much* grander scale. Asleep
in that dream is where you find yourself now. You are the Buddha trying to 
remember how to wake up, but mostly looking in all the wrong places. You 
investigate the "physical world" to explain its own operation, but this works 
no better than it could at night.

I would be lying if I said I could show you the Full Monty. Nonetheless, I
might be able to at least help you notice the mechanism that keeps you asleep.
Whether you choose to follow up beyond that is up to you.

The mind is made up of many layers. Near the surface are layers that give rise
to your thoughts, memories, sensations, personality, etc. Deeper layers give
rise to your metaphysical beliefs (i.e., beliefs about the nature
of reality), and deeper still, to the patterns you think of as "physics."
Notice that I use the word "mind," as "brain" refers to an illusory dream
object. Nonetheless, whenever I say "mind" you will instinctively *assume* 
"brain." This effortless conflation is itself a hint.

The layers that generate physics are close to what mystics call "God." As long
those layers are far beyond your conscious access, it can indeed be beneficial
to think of this as an entity distinct from yourself. Access can be achieved 
via something that I'm
perfectly happy to think of as "prayer" (though it scarcely matches the
traditional definition of the word). It involves *releasing* irrational beliefs, 
rather than adding new ones. There is also an emotional component involved.

The general idea is this: by questioning your beliefs in just the right way,
you may temporarily slice through the illusion. Proper incision can penetrate
deep layers of mind, allowing for subtle shifts in the dream's dynamics. These
shifts may not be consciously noticeable until they accumulate. Once they do
become detectable, there's still a very high probability that you will write 
them off as coincidence, thereby sealing the dream back up. You do this to 
forestall the potentially terrifying realization that this has all been a dream 
-- but this terror stems from a profound misunderstanding.

If you're serious about this, you'll have to become acutely aware of the knee-jerk
response you have to stuff every little thing into your worldview. It operates
continuously, normally beneath your conscious threshold. It is the same basic
process that operates in a nighttime dream: if a green elephant floats on by,
the mind produces a satisfying explanation ("oh, duh, green elephants always
come by on Zurxday!"). There's obviously much more consistency in this dream, 
but the same principle applies.

Almost nobody has the fortitude to stick with it, as the dream is carefully
constructed with sufficient internal consistency to lull all but the most 
curious back to sleep. 

We will later address the paradox of there being *other people* when this is
entirely your dream. A useful mental model is that this *is* your dream,
and everyone else is the Buddha waiting for you to wake up.

If you could perceive the sense in which **this** is the *first* (and perhaps
*only*) moment of existence, you would be overcome by heartbreaking beauty 
and dazzling glory literally beyond your wildest imagination -- because even
your imagination is constrained by your limited worldview. The immense awe,
wonder, gratitude, and love you would feel constitute a form of prayer, a fact
we will later make use of. Speaking religiously, this might be called "seeing
the face of God."

The closest that people normally get is to imagine that it's about "being in the 
now" or some similarly watered-down concept. But even if you accept the radical 
notion that ["it's always now"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3JzcCviNDk), 
it may be hard to see that the very concept "now" is only meaningful as a
dividing line between a future and a past. If you even subtly suspect a future 
and past, then *this* clearly isn't the first or only moment. To actually see 
what the Buddha is pointing to, you'll have to [transcend that entire conceptual 
structure](now.html).

Scientific theories by definition do not transcend that structure, their key
feature being that they are *conceptually explanatory*. Thus, while you should 
still rejoice in their beauty, recognize that they can never be *transcendent*
in the way we require here.

---

Let's start by questioning the past.

[We cannot say it is "likely" that the past really happened](past.html).
Similarly, it is not "unlikely" that it all popped into existence just now. 
Take a few moments and reflect deeply on this fact. Take *dead seriously* the 
possibility that you and the world popped into being *now*, and that the past 
is an illusion. Do this until you feel a little bit "tripped out."

There's a chance that you will be unable to feel even a little unusual. For
example, if your mind is busy explaining why there's nothing weird about this,
or why the past being real or fake makes no difference, then chances are you
won't actually bother to *look* in the way I'm prodding you to. It's a bit like
bungee jumping: you can stand arguing on the platform, or you can jump.

Notice that you can still perfectly well remember your own name or what you did 
yesterday. Just because you stop taking the past *literally* doesn't mean that 
you can't use it *functionally*. This is important to see, because one of the 
reasons you insist on taking everything so literally is that you're afraid you 
couldn't function otherwise. This is completely false.

On the flip side, you may see no reason *not* to take it literally: if 
you'll behave the same either way, what difference can it make? But the trippy
feeling you experienced should suggest that there *is* some difference. The 
point is not to feel continually tripped out, nor to parade around a new 
belief like "the past is an illusion," but to rediscover a certain lightness of 
being -- and to *empirically* discover how that affects 
the dream. And yet to think of this as a mere trick -- the past being real
after all -- would be to *completely* miss the point.

Now let's do something similar for the future. 

---

[There is no reason to believe that the laws of physics will continue to hold
even one second from now](future.html). It's not "unlikely" that things will
suddenly go haywire in any number of arbitrarily strange ways. Pay careful
attention to how intensely resistant your mind is to that conclusion. It would
much rather deny or dismiss it than confront it squarely. This offers a 
clear window into the process that keeps you asleep.

The rational mind is a gatekeeper. As long as it is certain about something,
we cannot see other possibilities. If you can understand clearly that you have
no reason to trust the past or future, you have *permission* to stop taking them 
so literally. Nonetheless, you must still walk through the gateless gate.

*[Sidebar: the [emotional reasons](emotional.html) to believe in a past and
future]*

With a lightness of past and a wide open future, the dream dynamics may begin
to shift. Perhaps unexpected doors open in your life. Some of these shifts can be 
easily explained (e.g., by changes in your behavior), but others may be harder. 
If there are any effects which verge on the magical -- that is, that test 
the boundaries of your worldview -- then your faith will be tested. Do you
double down on beliefs that you've already seen to be irrational (or at least
*un*rational)? Or do you chase the rabbit down the hole?

---

The idea of chasing the rabbit no doubt strikes you as insane. This fear is
not entirely unfounded: if you were to be exposed to the full truth without
adequate preparation, you may, in fact, [go insane](fear.html). You defend
against this possibility by being unable to take these ideas seriously. But
the fear results from a misunderstanding.

In a nighttime dream, the character walking around *in* the dream may have 
entirely different memories and personality than the one who fell asleep and *is
dreaming*. 

In a nighttime dream, you embody a dream character. It is not the *character*
who is dreaming, but you. The character would be right to say "I am not the
dreamer." And yet, in another sense, he would be wrong: if he searches for 
the source of his thoughts, the *referent* of that sense "I," he will 
rediscover the dreamer. Or rather, the dreamer will rediscover himself. The
dreamer take the perspective of the character, but the whole dream is a
manifestation of the dreamer's mind.



Similarly, to properly understand how "you" are dreaming, you must stop
pretending to be the dream character. This is called transcending the ego.

Even the *idea* that you are a dream character can be deeply unsettling, which 
is why Buddhism (amongst others) makes such
a strong point to develop qualities of the heart. The dreamer -- Buddha, God,
whatever word you like -- is not another *person*, but *unconditional love
itself*. Thus the *entire dream* is nothing but a manifestation of love --
though it probably doesn't appear that way to your character at present.

---

This section is the hardest to write, because it can only sound like moralizing,
and there is nothing that the mind hates more. But this is actually good news: 
it is encroaching on the core of the illusion.

If you really want to see it, learn to love unconditionally. It's easy
to love victims, but how easy is it to love perpetrators? The dirty politician, 
the greedy banker, the corrupt CEO? Their pain is so invisible to you -- and
often to themselves -- that the very possibility that their misdeeds are the
result of pain is considered preposterous and dangerously naive. They don't 
deserve our compassion, but our contempt.

It's the mother of all traps.

The more estranged we are from love, the more we lash out at the world. The
more we lash out, the more the world condemns us. The more it condemns us, the
deeper we bury our pain, putting on a mask of defiance.

Find whomever in the world is most deserving of your scorn, your judgement, your
disdain. Now do *whatever it takes* to love the hell out of them. In doing so,
you will discover a hidden aspect of your mind that is desperately calling out 
for love. It is your Shadow. You keep it hidden because it is too painful to 
admit, instead choosing to project it into the world. *They* deserve love 
because *you* deserve love. It is literally impossible to love yourself while 
reviling another.

Make no mistake: you may have to protest, imprison, or even potentially harm
someone, even as you love them. But only movements toward love can reveal the
dream's true nature, brightening it in the process. If you like to think of the 
dream as having a purpose, this is probably it.

There's not much more for me to share right now. The rest you will have to do
by yourself (or with friends and mentors). Remember, most of all, that it would
be foolish to take the world around you as evidence that it is *not* a dream.

* It is useful to reflect on the fact that [what you call "the world" is made
entirely of your mind](nature-of-mind.html). It is even more useful to
experience that insight directly.

* For a more poetic version of the above, which you may find a useful exercise,
read [this](consciousness.html).

* For something like physical evidence of the fact that this is *your* dream,
consider [quantum mechanics](quantum-woo.html).

* [Here](quotes.html) are a few quotes from contemplative traditions that are
relevant.

* Some [quotes](hypocrisy.html) where people confront the shadow in themselves.

* Quotes on [radical gratitude](radical-gratitude.html) and 
[radical self-love](radical-self-love.html). What makes them radical is that
you apply them even when (in fact, *especially* when) it seems absurd. Also 
incredibly useful are radical forgiveness, generosity, and kindness. Practice 
this on your friends and family, and then branch out. Override your instinct 
at every turn.
