>*When [Rechungpa] returned to Tibet after many years, his old master
  Milarepa came to welcome him on a barren plateau. After they had exchanged
  greetings and discussed Rechungpa's studies for some time, a violent
  hailstorm suddenly broke from out of the sky. There was nowhere to hide in
  the flat open plain. Milarepa spotted a yak horn on the ground and quickly
  took refuge inside of it -- without the horn becoming larger or Milarepa
  becoming smaller. From his dry shelter, Milarepa sang a song letting
  Rechungpa know that there was still plenty of space in the yak horn... if
  only his student had realized the nature of emptiness.*

>*You might think that the story of Milarepa's yak horn is merely a fairy
  tale. Or, if you are the credulous type, you might believe that it was a
  case of sorcery performed by the Tibetan yogi. But it is neither, as we
  will see.*

"Emptiness" refers to the core Mahayana Buddhist doctrine, which roughly
speaking, says that there is no way things actually are.
