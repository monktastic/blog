title: Consciousness as the ontological primitive
description:
---

The word "consciousness" is heavily overloaded. Here we will try to
outline an experiential process intended to point you toward
one very useful interpretation. To do so, we will need to use poetic
language. Ignore the literal meaning of the words here, and allow them
to be pointers to your own experience.

Silence is the absence of sound. Now, pay attention to any particular sound in
your environment, and recognize it as the presence of sound. "A sound" is some
particular presence of sound.

Now close your eyes and notice a (relative) absence of light/color. Now look at
something, and recognize it as the presence of color.

You can do the same thing with your other senses. Compare the presence of a
feeling (like pressing your fingers together) with an absence of feeling (in
that location, at least).

Now let us try to abstract away this *fact of presence* from its *details* (as
sights, sounds, etc.).

The senses are all different *modes* of presence, but what they have in common is
*presence itself*. Spend a minute and see if you can intuit what I might mean when
I say that presence is the very "stuff" out of which all experiences are made.
Presence, modulated in various ways, is the sole substance of your perceived
world. Really take a moment and notice this.

It is also the sole substance of your thoughts, memories, emotions, etc. Every
single thought you've ever thought, like every sound you've ever heard, is "made
of presence." When you're not paying careful attention to your mind -- which, as
we saw before, is almost always -- it is easy to overlook this insight. Even if
you understand it intellectually (and especially if you don't), it is worth
seeing for yourself.


Slowly (perhaps over the course of years) you may discover that even your sense
of identity is just a cluster of thoughts. You may already know this from
neuroscience, but now you begin to experience it directly. The illusion of
someone sitting inside your head, looking out at a world, starts to evaporate.


As this happens, you might start to reevaluate the belief that "I am conscious."
Who, pray tell, is conscious, if there's nobody there?

And now, slowly, slowly, it occurs to you that "consciousness" is just another
word for what we've here been calling "presence." It's not that there is some
object called a sound, and a subject called I, and some abstract property called
"consciousness" that magically links the two. Or rather, while that model of
reality may be useful, it's not your actual experience of the world -- even
though it has always seemed like it due to unexamined conceptualization.
Instead, this shimmering show you call "life" or "reality" is entirely *made of
consciousness* -- merely experiencing or illuminating *itself*.

So now what do you do with a belief like "consciousness exists" or
"consciousness does not exist?" You discover, directly, that those beliefs are
made of the very "stuff" they are questioning. Even the concept of "exists" or
"real" are made of it. Any answer you might muster is also it.

The sweater begins to unravel. A remarkable charade is exposed.

In each moment, the luminous fabric of consciousness weaves itself into a
dazzling array of sensual delights, as well as a thicket of mutually reinforcing
beliefs that together form your conception -- and thence experience -- of
reality. Whether or not any of those beliefs are true, it is astonishing to
discover how these beliefs form (and re-form) in each moment.

You really must see it for yourself.

Remarkably, during this model-building phase, consciousness brilliantly hides
itself from itself, taking on fiendishly clever forms such as "the stuff of the
world (aka matter) is all that *really* exists; consciousness is just an
illusion." And like a snake eating its own tail... poof!, the sole substance of
your reality seemingly vanishes into itself.

But it's always hiding in plain sight. It is what the Tibetans call
"self-secret." It's not that some yogis in an ancient cave have been hiding it
from you. It is *everything*. Yet somehow you are continually hiding it from
yourself. This game of hide-and-seek is known as Awakening, and they say it can
go on for as many cycles (lifetimes) as you wish.

It would be premature to conclude that consciousness is real while everything
else isn't. But, being the very fabric from which your beliefs are made, it is a
good place to hunt for the thread that unravels it all.
