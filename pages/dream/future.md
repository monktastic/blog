title: The problem of induction

### Summary

There is no (logical) reason to believe that the "laws of nature" will
continue to operate in the future.

See [David Hume's Problem of Induction](http://stephenlaw.blogspot.com/2012/10/problem-of-induction-explained-simply.html).

Briefly: the idea that things will *continue* to be true because they *have
been* consistently true is called the *principle of induction*. How do we
justify this principle? By observing that it's *been true* in
the past, and therefore will *continue* to be in the future. In other words,
the principle of induction is only justified via induction. This is circular
reasoning, and thus invalid. 

> **A**: The past is good evidence for the future.
>
> **B**: Why?
>
> **A**: Because that's been true in the past.
>
> **B**: Okay, and?
>
> **A**: Therefore it will continue to be true in the future.
>
> **B**: ... because?
>
> **A**: Duh, because the past is good evidence for the future!
>
> **B**: Oh, whew! You scared me for a second!
>
> **A**: Hooray, let's pretend everything is normal!

If there is only *circular* justification for the belief that the laws of 
physics will continue to operate, then there is *no* justification --
making it precisely as rational (or irrational) as the 
alternative. It is commonly misunderstood to mean "we cannot be *certain* of the 
future," but it cuts far deeper than that.

> *Many students new to philosophy misinterpret Hume: they think his conclusion is merely that we cannot be **certain** what will happen tomorrow. ...
  **[But] if Hume is right, the belief that the sun will rise tomorrow is as unjustified 
   as the belief that a million mile wide bowl of tulips will appear over the horizon 
   instead.** We suppose the second belief is insane. But if Hume is correct, the first belief is actually no more rational.
> ... 
> [T]he onus is on these defenders of “common 
   sense” to show precisely what is wrong with Hume's argument. No one has 
   yet succeeded in doing this (or at least no one has succeeded in 
   convincing a majority of philosophers that they have done so).*

As with the belief in [the past](past.html), it may be *practical* to assume 
that laws will continue to hold, but this is different from it being justified 
on *logical* grounds. Nonetheless, your mind will continue to believe it has
justified it: "well it's worked so far, and that's pretty good evidence!"

> *[Wheeler would] say things like, “In the end, the only law is that
  there is no law.” There’s no ultimate law of physics. All the laws of
  physics are mutable and that mutability itself is a principle of physics. He’d
  say, there’s no law of physics that hasn't been transcended. I saw this, and
  I remembered my joke about how the laws of physics must be wrong, and I was
  immensely attracted to this idea that maybe ultimately there actually are no
  laws of physics. What there is in place of laws, I didn't know. But if the
  laws weren't 100 percent trustworthy, maybe there was a back door to the
  stars.*
