### Summary

There is no (logical) reason to believe in the past.

Mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell:

> *There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.*

Forget "five minutes ago"; there's no way to prove that it didn't all just
spring into being *now*, with all the apparent evidence for a past (including
the objects and people around you, your memories, pictures from "yesterday", 
etc.) having been manufactured on the spot.

The first thing that will happen is you will think "well sure there's no way
to *prove* it, but that's obviously very unlikely."

How can well tell if it's likely or unlikely? Let's try various things.

* The laws of physics suggest it's extraordinarily unlikely.

The laws that were proven in the past and that you learned in the past? That's
circular reasoning.

* Occam's Razor suggests that the simplest solution is best, and a real
past is simpler.

Try justifying Occam's Razor without reference to the past. You only trust
Occam's Razor because it has worked before. Circular.

* But I've been reading this document for at least 30 seconds.

No you haven't; it all popped into being... *now*.

* Mathematically speaking, there are many more possibilities in which time
is real, so overall it is more likely that time is real.

* A theory's predictive power is a good test of its truth. A real past gives
more predictive power, so that's evidence of its correctness.

* ...

Again, try to justify these assertions. You will either find yourself starting
with axioms that presuppose time, or else making logical steps that assume 
it in some way or another.

Long story short: there is no justification that is not circular. Thus
there is no justification at all. How can you say that something is "very
likely" when you have no logical justification for it?

It is not "rational" to believe in time. You might argue that it's rational
because *believing* leads to better outcomes than *not believing*, but that's
just saying that it's *practical*. It is not grounded in *reason*, though it
certainly feels that way.

It may be *comfortable* or *convenient* to believe in the past, but that has
nothing to do with it being *likely* or *rational*.
