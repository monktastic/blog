It is impossible to prove that this isn't all just a dream. On the other hand,
it *is* possible to prove that it *is* a dream. Go ahead and imagine a strange
set of events or experiences that ought to convince beyond any reasonable
doubt. Be as radical as possible.

Whatever you just imagined, the actuality is stranger still.

The most common objection is "why don't I see any evidence?" The brief answer
is that this is *your* dream, so you'll have to let it in.

The next is "if this is my dream, then why can't I just wish [a million dollars]
into existence?" For a few reasons, most notably that you don't have conscious
access to the necessary layers of mind.

If you have any sense, everything I've said should sound like hogwash. That's
the sign of a good, healthy defense mechanism.

I can't show you the Full Monty, but I can try to point you in the right
direction.

First, recognize clearly that the decision to believe in materialism (that the
world is made of *stuff*) or idealism (that it's made of *mind*) is purely a
*choice*. There's no evidence (currently) that should sway you one way or the
other. This also means that you cannot say that either is "more likely" to be
true. *Make sure you understand this well.*

Next, notice how viscerally certain you *feel* that materialism is true, 
whatever your intellectual beliefs. Reach out and touch something, and notice
that part of you is dead certain that there's a "thing" made of "stuff" that's
responsible for the feeling. Through that mental act, you continually reinforce
your beliefs all day long. As we saw earlier, this is not logically justified.

You might think this is unavoidable: how could you stay alive if you didn't
think like this? The short answer is that you can have *practical* beliefs
without taking them *literally*. You can avoid a bus without the deep-seated
certainty that there is a "real bus" there.

There is no way to prove that the past really happened. Stranger
still, [we cannot say on logical grounds that it is even "likely."](past.html)
Thus we cannot say it is "unlikely" that the past is an illusion. Similarly, [it
is not "unlikely" that the laws of physics will suddenly stop operating in
five seconds](future.html).

If you confront these facts *very honestly*, you should feel the ground being
pulled out from under your feet at least a little. Then you will probably find
a reason to forget about them, and go back to reinforcing your unjustified
beliefs. Again, notice that you can still remember your past without taking
it literally.

If these beliefs are not logically justified, and you can function fine without
them, why do you keep reinforcing them? A common answer is that [it's
psychologically impossible](emotional.html) not to. Indeed, if you were to
suddenly see the whole truth without adequate preparation, you might actually
[go insane](insanity.html).

otice the splendor of colors and sounds happening all around you. Now
notice that you are subconsciously filling in all sorts of details about their
nature and relationship to you. You don't just hear "whoosh," you also think
"that's a car about 30 feet on my right." The hearing and thinking get woven
together so intimately that they become one thing: you simply *hear a car*.

But as we've seen, there's no way to *know* that there's really a car out there.
And yet, whether there's "really" a car or not seems to be irrelevant: if you
step out into traffic, something bad will happen, and so you might as well *say*
that there is "really" a car there.

But is there a way to take the car as a *practical* truth without taking it as
*literal* truth? And is there any value in doing so? The answer to both is a 
resounding *yes.* Let's use our belief in *time* as an example.

If you confront these facts very squarely, you ought to feel at least a little
weird. And yet, during that time, you will not have forgotten your name (for
example). This is a taste of using the past *practically* but not *literally.*
The weird feeling is you exposing a part of your mind that is *certain* it
knows things that it really *cannot* know. It really does not want to be found 
out. Crucially, it is not enough to understand *in the abstract* that you cannot
know: you must confront it until you feel an "oh, sh*t."

The normal continuation is to cover up that feeling and [move on](emotional.md)
as though nothing happened. This is because part of you realizes that this is a
rabbit hole you [might not be ready to go down](insanity.html). Don't 
underestimate the value of this defense mechanism. Luckily, if you
take the whole thing slowly, you will not go crazy. Quite the opposite, in fact.

If you could perceive the sense in which this may be the first (and possibly
only) moment of existence, you would be overwhelmed by a sense of wonder and
awe that simply cannot be reproduced while trapped in your normal cognitive
confines. This would begin to undermine the layers mentioned previously.

The closest people normally get is to imagine that it's about ["being
in the now"](now.html), but that's not nearly radical enough. The very
concept "now" is only meaningful as a dividing line between a real past and
future. That's a great first step, but it's still infinitely far. And again,
it is not enough to merely *understand* that you cannot know, because some part
of you will still be damn sure that it does.

In a meaningful sense, the splendor surrounding you *cannot* be adequately
explained. Or rather, you *can* explain it, but you have no reason to believe
that your explanation is more likely than any other. And yet, no matter how well
you understand the logic that goes into that statement, it will very likely
grate on you. This is a *fantastic* clue.

To keep this short, I'll give only a brief overview of other places where your
metaphysical baggage may weigh down your perception.

Pick a sound and listen to it. Notice that the experience you call "sound" is 
happening entirely within your own mind. In a sense, sound is ["made of"
*mind-stuff*](consciousness.html). I'm not trying to give you a new metaphysical
belief, but point to something. Notice that everything you call "the world" is, 
in this sense, simply your own mind manifesting in a myriad of ways.

Look around and say out loud: "this is all my own mind." Try to really 
appreciate this.

Notice how naturally you assume that there is also a "real world" somewhere that
is the *cause* of this mental manifestation. Notice also how seamlessly you
assume that where there is a *mind* there must be a *brain*. I am not going to
try to convince you that those are *wrong*, but as before, something unexpected 
and beautiful happens when you genuinely confront the fact that those 
assumptions are profoundly unjustified.

Again, you don't have to *start* believing in anything weird; you only need to
*stop* pretending that you know things that you don't.

The most important realization is hardest to communicate.

We normally feel like we are a "self" sitting inside a head, looking out at
the world.
