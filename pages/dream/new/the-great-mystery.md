**A**: We may not know *exactly* what life is yet, but we have a pretty good idea.

**B**: And what is that?

**A**: Well, the dictionary defines "life" as:

> *"The condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death."*

**A**: We know this has something to do with biochemical processes and ...

**B**: I think by "life" he means the *experience* you call life.

**A**: Oh, you mean consciousness? Again, we don't know *exactly*, but it has
something to do with neurons firing. You see, sodium ions go this way, and
potassium ions go that way. What's the big deal?

**B**: That's not exactly the question either. It's more like... "how did this
entire remarkable state-of-affairs come to be?"

**A**: Oh, you mean the Big Bang? Why didn't you just say so? As physicist 
Lawrence Krauss explains in "Something From Nothing," it's because the quantum 
vacuum is unstable. We basically get it.

**B**: Hmm, no, I think we're talking past each other.
