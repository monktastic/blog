Philosopher-mathematician Bertrand Russell once pointed out:

> *There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.*

It is not *impossible*, but it is certainly very *unlikely*, isn't it? Well, how
can we estimate its likelihood?

First, we might try to use evidence from our surroundings. A picture apparently
taken yesterday might *seem* like evidence for a real past, but how do we know
that it, too, didn't pop into existence five minutes ago? So physical evidence
doesn't do us much good.

Instead we might try to attack it on principle. It's unlikely because, well...
the world just doesn't work that way! The problem, of course, is that this claim
assumes that our knowledge from the past is reliable. This is circular
reasoning.

Next we might try Occam's Razor. But it is not a law; it just says that simpler
hypotheses have *tended* to be correct. It is something that we have discovered
through *past* experimentation. Again, circular. Alternatively, it can be
understood to mean that it's *unnecessary* to introduce complicated hypotheses
when simpler ones will do. But without past evidence to justify it, this is just
a statement about *convenience*.

You'll find that the only way we can prove the "unlikeliness" of the hypothesis
is by assuming it in the first place. In the end, it turns out that we cannot do
any better than simply *asserting* that it's false. And why shouldn't we? It
seems like a pretty useless hypothesis anyway. As Russell himself says:

> *Skepticism, while **logically impeccable**, is **psychologically
impossible**, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any
philosophy which pretends to accept it.*

In a similar way, David Hume's *Problem of Induction* demonstrates that it is no
more likely that the laws of physics will continue to hold five minutes from now
than that they will suddenly fall apart. But in the end he, too, loses his
nerve:

> *Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument which
I have been to such pains to inculcate, whether I be really one of those
skeptics who hold that everything is uncertain, I should reply that
neither I nor any other person was ever sincerely and constantly of
that opinion. I dine, I play backgammon, I converse and am merry with
my friends and when after three or four hours of amusement I would return
to these speculations, they appear so cold and strange and ridiculous
that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any further. Thus the
skeptic still continues to reason and believe, though he asserts he
**cannot defend his reason by reason.***

A third example of a weird hypothesis is *solipsism* -- the idea that the whole
world is a figment of your imagination. We run into the same problem trying to
refute it. Yes, you cannot change your surroundings at will, but maybe that's
only because you haven't become *lucid* yet. We cannot do any better than
throwing up our hands and saying "aw, come on!"

These and other radically skeptical hypotheses not only cannot be disproved;
they cannot even be rationally characterized as "unlikely." As numerous
philosophers have recognized through the ages, our only recourse is to *decide*
that they are false, so that we can get on with our lives.

> *While no great philosopher has explicitly espoused solipsism, this can
be attributed to the inconsistency of much philosophical reasoning. Many
philosophers have failed to accept the logical consequences of their own
most fundamental commitments and preconceptions.*

Physicist Sean Carroll puts it this way:

> *There is no way to distinguish between the scenarios by
collecting new data.*
>
> *What we’re left with is our choice of prior credences. We’re **allowed
to pick** priors however we want—and every possibility should get some
nonzero number. But it’s okay to set our prior credence in radically
skeptical scenarios at very low values, and attach higher prior credence
to the straightforwardly realistic possibilities.*
>
> *Radical skepticism is less useful to us; it gives us no way to go
through life. All of our purported knowledge, and all of our goals and
aspirations, might very well be tricks being played on us. But what
then? We cannot actually act on such a belief, since any act we might
think is reasonable would have been suggested to us by that annoying
demon. Whereas, if we take the world roughly at face value, we have a
way of moving forward. There are things we want to do, questions we
want to answer, and strategies for making them happen. **We have every
right to give high credence to views of the world that are productive
and fruitful, in preference to those that would leave us paralyzed
with ennui.***

This point is very important to understand. It feels *very much* like our model
of the world is based on reason, but it is not. It is a pure choice. In a very
important sense, there is *no reason* (other than convenience) to believe that
the world existed even one moment ago. In the same way, it is not "unlikely"
that the world is a figment of your imagination -- though, as we saw in the last
section, "you" here does not refer to the character *in* the dream, but to *the
one who dreams.*

But so what? What is to be gained from believing any of this weird stuff?

The answer is that *if* this is your dream, then a critical first step to
discovering that fact would be to *stop* assuming that it's false. Let's unpack
that a bit.

In a nighttime dream, what is it that prevents you from recognizing that you're
dreaming? The primary obstacle is your unquestioned belief in its reality. By
genuinely questioning it, you can become lucid. In a similar way, it is possible
to know that this is your dream. The main thing stopping you is that every time
you pause to consider it, your rational mind convinces you that it's irrational
to take it seriously.

If you want to wake up, the first thing you must do is learn to recognize this
as a lie.
