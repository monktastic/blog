## The setup

Have you ever felt that life is magical? If you're like most people, you
probably recognize that while it may *feel* magical, it can't be *literally*
true. The world operates according to laws, not magic.

But if it *were* literally true, would there be a way of knowing it?

## A nice dream

Imagine being in a nighttime dream. Your dream character's name is Character,
and your waking self is named Dreamer. Character doesn't necessarily share any
of Dreamer's traits or memories. In fact, suppose you (as Character) have no
concept of Dreamer at all.

One day you are stunned by a gorgeous red flower and are driven to ask: what
causes me to see this brilliant hue? Using the scientific method, you discover
that the Sun is emitting photons, which reflect off flavonoids in the flower,
get transduced by opsins in your retina, turn into electrical impulses that
travel to your visual cortex, and voilÃ ! You now have a complete description of
how you see a red flower. No magic necessary.

Then one dream day you become
*[lucid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream)* in your dream. You discover,
beyond any doubt, that the entire dream is made of your mind. Not *Character's*
mind, but *Dreamer's*. The experience called "brilliant red flower" is not
produced by any phenomenon *inside* the dream, and certainly not by anything
inside Character's imaginary skull. It is simply Dreamer's mind, *glowing* --
just like everything else that you (as Character) have been seeing, smelling,
tasting, hearing, touching, and thinking. The whole dream is made of a
luminosity that comes from beyond the dream itself.

---

In essentially the same way, what you presently experience as "the world" -- all
the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, textures, thoughts, etc. -- are made of your
mind, but not your *personal* mind. Not something inside your skull, despite all
the empirical evidence very suggestively hinting that way. Not by anything in
"reality" at all. In other words, what you call "life" is not caused by anything
*within* the world. It is, in this sense, genuinely magical.

You are not the dream character you normally take yourself to be. What you
really are is *that which glows realities into existence*. As ludicrous as that
sounds, it is something that can be known with certainty. To discover it, you
must become *lucid*.

This is not easy to do, but here we will give a general overview of how it can
be done.

## Radical skepticism

Philosopher-mathematician Bertrand Russell once pointed out:

> *There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.*

It's not *impossible*, but it's very *unlikely*, isn't it?

The difficulty is that to determine how "likely" something is, we need to start
with some assumptions. For example, we might say "it's unlikely because the
world just doesn't work that way." But this is circular reasoning: it assumes
that what we learned in the past is valid, and not just a false memory.

Occam's Razor doesn't help, either. It says that simpler hypotheses have
*tended* to be correct, but this again relies on past evidence. We can take the
Razor to mean that simpler hypotheses should be *preferred*, but without any
evidence, it cannot help us determine which is more *likely*.

Thus we cannot say it is "unlikely." Only that it is pointless and unhelpful.

In a similar way, consider *idealism*, the hypothesis that the whole world is
fundamentally mental in nature. Various objections can be made, but they all
ultimately rest on assumptions that presuppose its falsity. There is no unbiased
test that could evaluate its likelihood versus the standard materialist view.
Thus, we cannot say that either one is more "likely." We ought to pick whichever
makes our life easiest.

A third example is David Hume's "Problem of Induction," which demonstrates that
there is no more reason to believe that the laws of physics will continue to
operate five minutes from now than that they will suddenly unravel. As strange
as it may seem, neither case is more "likely."

Let's recap. It is *not unlikely* that the world popped into being five minutes
ago, or that it is all made of your mind, or that the laws of physics will
suddenly fall apart in five minutes. But no matter how well you understand this
intellectually, notice how viscerally certain you are that all these things are
utter nonsense.

Something deep in your mind is clutching *desperately* to ideas that it has no
reason to believe. One of the keys to becoming lucid is learning to not listen
to that irrational voice.
