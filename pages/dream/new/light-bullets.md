Even the faintest
whisper of recognition brings the joy and release you secretly long for.

It is extremely tricky to communicate. There is much in here for the mind to
quibble with. But I'm not really trying to convince you of anything. I'm only
trying to get you to notice something you've been overlooking.

Even if you understand everything I say, you might still think "so what?" If so,
chances are that one or more points hasn't been digested completely. It is one
thing to *understand* this, and another to really *grok* it.

1. **Recognize the Light**

 Close your eyes and listen to a sound. Compare the sound with silence. It is
 as though sound is an *energy* emanating from that background.
  
 Can you sense how sound is *made of* this energy?
 
 Now look at an object. Compare it with seeing darkness. Can you sense how the
 colorful splotch is like an energy manifesting out of that void?
 
 Can you abstract away the details of *sound* and *color*, and notice that
 it's the very same "substance" that manifests as both? It is the energy of
 your own mind, taking on myriad forms: now a whistle; now a honk; 
 now vibrant red.
 
 We'll call this energy the "Light."

1. **Notice that your entire reality is made of the Light**

 The Light is not limited to sound and vision. All smells, tastes, and
 textures are its expression as well.
 
 Your thoughts, emotions, and memories are it, too. Stop and notice a thought.
 Can you sense how it is the energy of your own mind, manifesting?
 
 Everything you've ever encountered has been the Light of your mind, in one 
 form or another. It constitutes the entirety of the experience you call
 "the world."

1. **Notice that it is all that you can *ever* know**

 Not only is it all you've ever known; it is all you can ever know.
 
 "Knowing" or "experiencing" are just different ways of speaking about the
 Light. It is the very *essence* of knowing or experiencing.

1. Notice that you cannot be sure of anything else (radical skepticism)

 [Add links to other pieces]
 
 You cannot know whether matter, time, and space really exist. In fact, you
 cannot even say it is "likely" that they do.
 
 You cannot be certain of *anything* other than the sheer fact of Light.
 If you try to be uncertain about the Light, stop and notice that this
 experience of uncertainty is also the Light.
 
 It is very important to note that we are not making a metaphysical claim.
 We are not saying that there is some real thing out there called Light.
 We are just drawing your attention to the one thing you know, even as you
 doubt it.

1. Recognize that you can never have an explanation for the Light

 Finding the *cause* of the sole ingredient of reality, from *within* that
 reality, is not just *hard* but *nonsensical*. This is very difficult to 
 convey, but let's try.

 Imagine you are having a nighttime dream and see a beautiful red rose. You
 decide to become a scientist to discover *why* you see this vivid red.
 You go about collecting all the evidence you need: some dream-photons leave
 the dream-sun, reflect off of dream-carotenoids and dream-flavonoids in the
 dream-flower, get transduced by dream-photoreceptors, and make their way into
 the dream-visual-cortex....
 
 Yet no matter how precise you make this chain of associations, you will forever
 be completely wrong. The true cause of the Light is beyond the dream itself. 
 Nonetheless, you will become increasingly convinced that you've nailed it, or
 are at least getting closer.

 Your current situation is the same. Your world is made of Light. Its cause
 cannot be meaningfully found within the world. You may argue that although
 your *experienced* world is made of Light, the *real world* is made of stuff.
 For example, there's a *real brain* somewhere that's *causing* all this Light.
 
 This is the point where you must muster all your courage and realize that
 there's *no reason to believe so.* You can come up with all manner of lovely
 stories about what's causing it, but .

1. Notice that the Light is nondual

 This one is especially tricky to communicate.
 
 Nobody there
 Nobody to be hurt or die
