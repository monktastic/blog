"Life is miraculous"

What is this statement trying to express? According to the dictionary, we have:

> Life (n): the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic 
matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, 
and continual change preceding death.

We used to think this was caused by some "elan vital" (vital force), but as 
science improved, we dispelled that superstition. As Wikipedia explains:

> "Current general consensus by geneticists is that they see no life force 
other than the organisational matrix contained in the genes themselves."

These days we know that nothing is literally miraculous. Miraculous means
something more like "really amazing." So: the capacity for certain kinds of 
matter to do certain things is pretty darn amazing. Who could argue with that? 
But the statement has a deeper meaning and origin.

Imagine being in a nighttime dream. Your dream character's name is Character,
and your waking self is named Dreamer. Character doesn't necessarily share any
of Dreamer's traits or memories. In fact, you (as Character) have no concept of
Dreamer at all.

One day you come across a red flower and are driven to ask: what causes me to
see this brilliant shade? Using the scientific method, you discover that the
Sun is emitting photons, which bounce off flavonoids in the flower, then get 
transduced by opsins in your retina, into signals which travel to your 
visual cortex, and voila! You have a complete description of how you see a red 
flower.

Then one dream day you have a *lucid dream*. You discover, beyond any doubt,
that the entire dream is made of *Dreamer's mind* -- which is somehow also
*your* mind. The experience called "brilliant red flower" is not generated by
any phenomenon *inside* the dream. It is certainly not generated by anything
inside Character's skull.

In the same way, what you experience as "the world" -- all the sights, sounds,
smells, tastes, textures, thoughts, etc. -- are made of your mind, but not of
your *personal* mind. Not something inside your skull, despite all the empirical
evidence suggestively hinting that way. Not by anything in "reality" at all.

In other words, the experience you know as "life" is genuinely miraculous in
a meaningful sense. This sense is hard to communicate, but it can be known
directly, by *waking up*.

A common concern is how one can know that one actually *woke up*, as opposed to 
simply having had a hallucination. A complete answer is beyond the scope
of this piece, but here we shall say a few words.

If one is sufficiently advanced in nighttime lucid dreaming, then during the
transition into and out of the dream, it is possible to introspect precisely
upon the mechanisms that generate and maintain the dream. One literally sees the
entire process by which one weaves a reality and then loses oneself in it. To 
keep the dream as realistic as possible, the character is rarely allowed to 
retain any of the details. Nor is she at first equipped with enough skepticism
to deeply question her beliefs.

Nonetheless, the memory of having seen the truth does occasionally waft into
consciousness. Because the truth does not fit into our limited worldview, we 
settle for a mere shadow of it: "life is miraculous." It *is*, but not in the
way we normally think. Understanding this can be a powerful tool in the
awakening process.

Similarly, we have been trying to crack the "hard problem of consciousness" --
the question of how consciousness could arise from matter -- for a long time,
with little success. Some call consciousness "the last remaining mystery."
Others pooh-pooh this as a backwards notion, but again, it actually *is* one in
a meaningful sense.

And then at the cutting edge of science we have quantum mechanics and its
"measurement problem." Caltech physicist Sean Carroll:

> *For quantum mechanics, all we really have to do (most people believe) is think about it in the right way. No elaborate experiments necessarily required (although they could help nudge us in the right direction, no doubt about that). But if anything, that makes the embarrassment more acute. All we have to do is wrap our brains around the issue, and yet we’ve failed to do so.*

Why have we failed to do so?

Often when people suggest that it's somehow connected
with the problem of consciousness, they're shouted down for being crackpots.
On the other hand, some of the very sharpest minds do seem to get it. Here's
Edward Witten, a physicist so overpoweringly smart that his fellow theoretical 
physicists casually throw around terms like ["smarter than anyone else"](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/magazine/a-theory-of-everything.html?pagewanted=all) and "head and shoulders above the rest":

> *I think consciousness will remain a mystery. Yes, that's what I tend
to believe. I tend to think that the workings of the conscious brain
will be elucidated to a large extent. Biologists and perhaps physicists
will understand much better how the brain works. But why something that
we call consciousness goes with those workings, I think that will remain
mysterious. I have a much easier time imagining how we understand the
Big Bang than I have imagining how we can understand consciousness...*

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected
with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that
has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum
mechanics and its applications to the universe.*

> *Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make
sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the
observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely
uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash
with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics,
and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go
away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.*
