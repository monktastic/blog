I'd like to share with you the Purpose of Life. Big claim, I know.

The purpose of life is to notice that you are engulfed in a miracle whose
glory exceeds your wildest imagination, and to live continually from that
realization.

Let's break that down. What is this supposed "miracle?"

## The Light

First, I want to introduce you to the Light. It's a funny kind of introduction,
in that you already know it intimately. But you may not know *that* you know.

Close your eyes and attend to a sound. For me, it's the sound of traffic here
in NYC.

I want you to compare the experience of hearing a sound, with the experience of
silence. Can you notice how sound is like an **energy** manifesting out of the
background void of silence? You might try to visualize this sound as being
*made of* that energy, not unlike how a character on a movie screen is made of 
light.

Listen to a sound again, and recognize it as a manifestation of this energy. 
For me, the energy is manifesting as a police siren; now as a bird chirping;
now as a jackhammer.

This energy can also manifest itself as *sights*. It takes the form of color,
and splatters itself across your visual field. This is a different manifestation
than sound, but it's the same principle. "Something" is shining, in the form of
sights and sounds. It's also shining as textures, smells, tastes, and thoughts.
Take a moment and notice this.

It is this energy I'm calling the "Light," and it comprises everything you've
ever thought of as your life or world. It is the Light of your own mind, shining
as the myriad forms you collectively call "reality."

## The Nature of Light

You might be thinking, "so what?" We know that different neurons fire, giving 
rise to different experiences. Why give that process a new, mystical name?

This point is exceptionally subtle to convey, but I'm going to try.

Imagine you're having a dream at night. You see a beautiful red flower. The
experience is so stunning that you're driven to ask "why do I see red?"

You go about collecting all the evidence you need: some dream-photons leave
the dream-sun, reflect off of dream-carotenoids and dream-flavonoids in the
dream-flower, get transduced by dream-photoreceptors, and make their way into
the dream-visual-cortex....

It's true that most dreams are not nearly consistent and intricate enough to
support such investigations, but use your imagination. The reasoning still
holds.

The more carefully you investigate that chain of associations, the more confident
you will be that you've found the true *cause* of the vivid redness. But you
will forever be wrong, because the true cause of that light is *beyond* the 
dream itself, in the mind of the dream*er*. All you can do from within the
dream is discover associations: when *this* happens, *that* happens. In one
sense, this gets you closer to discovering the "cause" of the light; in another
sense, you never gain even an inch of ground. The dream itself is *made* of 
light; to seek the cause of the light -- and thus the cause of the dream -- 
from *within* the dream, is not just hard, but nonsensical.

Now notice that as far as you can *ever* know, the situation is the same for
you right now. You can never prove that you're not in a simulation or dream.
If you reason carefully, you will discover that you cannot even say that it is
"likely" that you're not.

## So what?

You can never be even a little bit sure about the nature of reality. And yet 
you *can* be sure of the Light. If you are able to notice these two facts at
the same time, something radical and remarkable may happen. You will be
dumbstruck by overwhelming awe, gratitude, and wonder beyond your wildest
imagination. You will be moved to tears by the realization that this is the 
*one* thing you've always wanted, and yet it's always been closer than your own 
nose. How have you overlooked it for so long?

What I'm saying may sound nutty to you right now. "Wait, just because I can't
prove I'm not dreaming, I'm supposed to be impressed by this 'Light' thing?"

If this were easy to convey, I doubt we'd have so many religions, so much
blood shed over them, or so much strife in general. This is just my attempt to
communicate my perspective. Let me try to summarize it again.

First, notice that your world is made of Light. I'm using this word poetically,
as a pointer back to your own experience. I'm asking you to notice the sole
ingredient of your life and world.

Second, realize that you have no reason to believe that space, time, etc. are
real in the way you normally assume. You can understand this part using careful
reasoning, but that won't be enough. A deep layer of your mind is convinced that
it *can* and *does* know the true nature of reality, and your intellect almost
certainly does not have enough authority to pry its grip off. This is actually
the purpose of meditation: to relax not just your normal thoughts, but this deep
part of you that goes on pretending it *knows*. It really, really doesn't.
 
The more you notice the Light, and the less you pretend to know what's causing
it, the more that life will appear as a precious and profound spectacle, and
the less it will seem mundane. In fact, look at the definition of "mundane":

```
mundane /ˌmənˈdān/ (adj.):

1. Worldly, earthly, profane, vulgar as opposed to heavenly.
2. Pertaining to the Universe, cosmos or physical reality, as opposed to the spiritual world.
3. Ordinary; not new.
4. Tedious; repetitive and boring.
```

It's no coincidence that the word means both "pertaining to physical reality"
and "tedious; repetitive, and boring." Your life feels vaguely tedious because
you're convinced you understand its nature. When you can *very deeply* admit
that you don't (and can't), the Light can finally shine in all its spectacular 
glory. It will become obvious that what you've always been seeking has been 
hiding in plain sight, closer than your own eyes. 

The process may take a day,
or (more likely) years, but it is always worth it. At some point you will have 
your own way of describing it, and think "well why didn't he just say so?" 
Until then, you might consider this all a load of hooey.

## And then?
