Have you ever felt profound awe at the fact that you exist? Or that anything at
all exists?

It's easy to overlook its profundity. For example, you could invoke a form of
the Anthropic Principle: "If I *didn't* exist, I wouldn't be around to be
surprised. The sheer fact that I'm able to ask the question *implies* that I
exist, so it's not very surprising."

That's fine as far as it goes.
But there *is* something miraculous about existence, and though it's not
possible to convince you of it, I can offer some tips that might help you know
it for yourself. As far as I can tell, seeing and living this is more or less
"the meaning of life."

Big claim, I know.

First, let's get clear on what we mean by "existence." 

Close your eyes and
listen to a sound. For me, it's the sound of traffic. There's a "whoosh." Now
pay close attention to the "whoosh", and try to answer: what is that "whoosh"
*made of?*

You might answer something like "air molecules" or "vibrations." But even in a
dream, you can hear a "whoosh," despite there being no air moving. So that can't
be it. Next, you might try to answer "neurons" or "neurotransmitters." But as 
far as you can ever know, physical reality is a simulation, and there are no 
real neurons either. So let's take a different perspective.

Imagine being in a dream. The vast space surrounding you is the space of your
own mind. Now imagine that this mind-space is imbued with the *potential for 
experience*. This *potentiality* becomes *manifest* in the form of particular 
experiences. In other words, your *mind itself* is shining in the form of the 
*whoosh* experience. That *whoosh* is the latent capacity of mind, made
manifest. It is "made of" your own mind.

This is true even of your waking experience. While there may be real objects
out there that are the *cause* of these experiences, all you ever come into
contact with are the experiences themselves; the mind itself.

Really stop and get a feeling for this, how your mind shines forth as
experiences. Once you have a feel for it with sounds, try it out with sights,
textures, smells, and tastes. Notice that even *thoughts* are experiences,
illuminated in the same way.

Everything you've ever called "the world" has been your own mind, shining.
Point at something and say out loud: "this is my mind."
When you are in awe that "I exist" or "the world exists," you are actually
noticing that "wow, [there is] *shining!*"

Where there is a mind, there must be a brain. Or at least, that's what we've
come to believe. Let's dig a little bit into this.

Imagine again that you're in a dream. You see a bright red flower, and want to 
understand why you see the color red. You might become a physicist and study 
dream-photons. You might become a biologist and study dream-photoreceptors. Or a 
neuroscientist, studying dream-neurons. Normally, dreams don't have enough 
internal consistency and detail for these things to be possible, but use your 
imagination.

Even if you're the greatest scientist in your dream world, you will never discover
the true cause of the red experience, because *nothing within the dream is causing
it*. But since the dream is all that exists for you, there's no way you can
even make sense of such a claim. If someone were to tell you that the source of 
shining is external to the dream, you'd have to call them crazy. Besides, you've 
worked out all the necessary correlations: when *this* particle hits *that* one, 
it triggers *this* photoreceptor, which causes *that* neuron to fire, so we *do*
know the cause of the red-experience. There's nothing left to explain.

You'd know all this with certainty, and you'd be totally wrong.

One dream day you decide to study the mystical art of "Lucid Dreaming." It's 
supposedly a way to "wake up," whatever that means. You're already awake, after 
all. The instructions involve sitting and staring at a flower, allowing your 
thoughts to settle. For a while, it's pretty boring. But it slowly helps you 
become focused and relaxed, which helps you do science better, so maybe it's not 
*totally* worthless.

Then one day, while you're staring at the flower, it hits you like a ton of
bricks: *I'm dreaming!* And as that happens, your entire perspective shifts.
You are overwhelmed with joy. You realize you were never really the dream 
character, but the dreamer, fast asleep in your bed in another world. You go 
from *understanding* that the
world is your own mind, to *experiencing it* directly. To the degree that you
experience it, the dream's dynamics begin to synchronize with your intentions.

But you soon fall out of the realization, back into your scientist self. It's
impossible for your dream-mind to encode the memory of having been truly awake,
but you retain vague, faint hints. "I can't remember why exactly, but this
Lucid Dreaming thing is more interesting than I realized. I wish I had more time
to study it, but I'm being chased by this six-legged bear!"

Over time, your skill grows. You begin to see how exactly the dream is 
constructed. You learn to unravel the dream, almost like pulling a loose thread
in a sweater.
