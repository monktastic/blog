In a nighttime dream, all manner of strange things can happen. But there's only
one kind of thing that can happen that is "perpendicular" to the dream: waking
up.

Waking up normally involves popping *out* of the dream reality and into another
one (waking reality), but it can also involve popping *into* the dream reality.
This is called *lucid dreaming*. If you've never had a lucid dream, it's almost
impossible to convey the bizarreness or magnificence of the experience. You can 
literally *wake up* into your full waking awareness, while still being engulfed 
in an entirely imaginary universe.

This epiphany can occur in degrees. At the higher levels, it can be one of
the trippiest experiences a person can have. At lower levels, it might not feel
like much more than "book knowledge" -- as though you read somewhere that this
is all a dream, idly acknowledged this useless fact, and continued about your 
day. This accounts for [the skeptical opinion that there is no such state](http://skepdic.com/lucdream.html):

> *Some skeptics do not believe that there is such a state as lucid dreaming (Malcolm 1959). Skeptics don't deny that sometimes in our dreams **we dream that we are aware** that we are dreaming. What they deny is that there is special dream state called the 'lucid state.'*

When done properly, you don't just "dream that you are aware." You *are aware*.
At that point there is no need for wiggle words.

What I mean by "perpendicular" to the dream is that lucidity need not change
any of the *contents* of the dream. Whatever was happening in the dream can
continue to happen[1]. Because of this, it can be hard to convey or motivate.
Imagine a conversation you might have with a dream character (DC):

> **DC**: Dude, you should totally try *lucidity!*
>
> **You**: Why? What does it do for me?
>
> **DC**: You discover that this is all a dream and that you don't exist in
the way you normally assume!
>
> **You**: That's cool and all, but does it get me more money?
>
> **DC**: Not necessarily...
>
> **You**: Okay, how bout more babes?
>
> **DC**: Um maybe, but...
>
> **You**: Does it raise my IQ?
>
> **DC**: You're kinda missing the point. *This whole reality* is made out of
your mind, but not "you" as in the dream character you assume yourself to be!
>
> **You**: Whatever. I don't have time for your unscientific religious beliefs. 
I'm busy running away from this very real dragon!

The mystical traditions of our world have been trying to convey something
similar to us, and we reject it for pretty much the same reasons. It's just too
ridiculous to be true. And yet, it *is* true. Rather than waste more breath
trying to convince you of the fact, I'd like to offer some hints on how you can
become lucid, putting it beyond any doubt whatsoever. It's not easy, but it is
possible.
