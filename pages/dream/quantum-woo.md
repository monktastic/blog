### Preface

I am not a physicist, but a software engineer who has some training in quantum
information science. I am far from being an expert, but I can tell you a bit
about density operators on Hilbert space (which is about all the math you'd need
to work this all out yourself). Everything I say in the main section here is,
to the best of my knowledge, accurate and reasonably well-accepted[9]. There
are mathematical footnotes if you feel like going deeper.

As this piece is part of a series on metaphysical idealism, I will make some
interpretations that may be hard to swallow. That section is indicated as
speculation.

---

In a "Schrödinger's Cat"-style experiment, there is a radioactive particle that 
does or does not decay. *Both* possibilities exist together in a 
*superposition*. It triggers (or does not) a device, which then kills (or does 
not) a cat. Now the particle, device, and cat are *together* in a superposition.
As more pieces of the world (including people) encounter the system, they too 
join the superposition. You can think of the experiment as having two 
"branches," corresponding to the two possible outcomes. 

When the experiment is still at the single-particle stage, it is easy to demonstrate
the superposition (via an *interference experiment*). Doing so requires precise
control of *all* involved particles. As the experiment grows to involve more
objects, this quickly becomes impossible *in practice* (a fact known as
*decoherence*), but crucially, as far as we know, it never becomes impossible
*in theory*[0][1]. It remains in superposition. You cannot say that the cat has
a well-defined fate, because the right experiment would give lie to that claim.

Yet when *you* encounter the system[2], you never *see* a superposition -- 
whatever that would mean. You always see one result or the other. Now, the cat 
*does* have a single well-defined fate. This is also the first time it has a 
well-defined *history*: one second ago, you couldn't say "the cat is dead," but 
now you *can* say "one second ago, the cat was dead"[3]. To put that in slightly
different wording: one second ago the cat wasn't dead, but now, one second ago
it was dead.

This isn't just a matter of interpretation, either; it has physical 
consequences. At this point it is impossible *even in theory* for you -- *or 
anyone else* -- to demonstrate superposition[4]. Again, this happens precisely 
when *you* encounter it.

Why doesn't this weird everyone out[5]? Because there are a few places it is 
easy to hide the weirdness.

First, because of decoherence, it's easy to pretend that the superposition
disappeared early on, long before it got to you. Even if you accept that
decoherence doesn't solve it[6], it's easy to say "well *something* must have
ended the superposition somehow, somewhere, somewhen, because otherwise WTF."
In fact, this is roughly called the Copenhagen Interpretation, and it has been
the party line for over a century[7].

Second, if we look at this from a "God's-eye perspective," then all that really
happened was that *you* joined the superposition. Both branches still exist,
with one "copy" of you seeing each result. This is basically the Many Worlds 
Interpretation. While God may not find any of this strange, it doesn't make the 
situation any less weird for *you.*

From your perspective, you seem to be the sole "observer." In an interesting
sense, this is *your* world[8].

### Some speculation

Everything I've said above is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate and
reasonably well-accepted[9]. Now for some speculation.

Physicists tend to hate attempted associations between QM and consciousness,
but this is a good time to point something out. This whole problem exists 
because you "see" only one result. If you try to pin down what it means to "see" 
a result, you will discover yourself closing in on what it means to be 
*conscious* of that result. In this sense, the problem *is* intimately linked 
to consciousness[10].

It seems I am not the only one who thinks so:

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected
with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that
has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum
mechanics and its applications to the universe.*
>
> &nbsp;...
>
> *Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make
sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the
observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely
uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash
with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics,
and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go
away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.*

So here's another way of looking at the problem. Recall that, in a particular
sense, what you call "the world" is, in fact, 
[made of consciousness](nature-of-mind.html). From this perspective, it is
hardly surprising that your becoming *conscious* of the result coincides 
precisely with it *having* one: these are two ways of speaking about the same
thing. Said another way, the world comes into being as you become conscious
of it because your consciousness **is** "the world."

Following this idea to its logical conclusion seems [insane](insanity.html),
and for good reason. I suspect that we will not "wrap our brains around the
issue" until we begin to address [the root problem](overview.html).

> *For quantum mechanics, all we really have to do (most people believe) is think about it in the right way. No elaborate experiments necessarily required (although they could help nudge us in the right direction, no doubt about that). But if anything, that makes the embarrassment more acute. All we have to do is wrap our brains around the issue, and yet we’ve failed to do so.*

### Notes and references

[0] Roger Penrose (2004), The Road to Reality, pp. 802-803:

> ...the environmental-decoherence viewpoint ... maintains that state 
vector reduction can be understood as coming about because the
environmental system under consideration becomes inextricably entangled
with its environment.[...] We think of the environment as extremely
complicated and essentially 'random' [... but] **there is no general 
principle providing an absolute bar to extracting information from the 
environment.**[...] Accordingly, such descriptions are referred to as FAPP 
[For All Practical Purposes].

It should be noted that some are looking for "(in-principle) irreversible 
decoherence." See this [interesting paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3796). 
Nonetheless, no such mechanism has been found.

[1] There is also the possibility of "collapse of the wave function," but very
little reason to believe in such a deus-ex-machina. There's very little
experimental support for it, and it's very ugly theoretically (being
nondeterministic and irreversible, unlike the rest of physics).

Note that we have demonstrated superposition for at least trillions of 
(well-controlled) particles. See, e.g. [here](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2010/mar/18/quantum-effect-spotted-in-a-visible-object).
As we do bigger and bigger experiments, the collapse hypothesis becomes less and
less likely.

[2] Either directly or indirectly, such as via a friend telling you, or stray
photons giving you information. An interesting question is what precisely
constitutes you getting information, but that is beyond our scope here.

[3] Note the sense in which the history is not a record of what happened,
but a retroactive story to make the present consistent.

[4] At least, in any way that could be shown to you while you still have 
knowledge of the cat's fate. For your perspective to remain consistent, when
you compare notes with anyone else, they will have seen the same result as you.

It is true that someone *outside* the system (i.e., not yet entangled with it)
can still demonstrate superposition, but you are now part of the system they
are experimenting on, and they cannot show you the result without something
like quantum erasure, making you forget the original result.

[5] Or maybe it *does* weird everyone out.

  mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright
  hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.*

[6] [The decoherence myth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

[8] Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner was (in)famous for his interpretation that
conscious beings cause collapse, but we can see that he perhaps did it to avoid 
this stranger conclusion (in 1967):

> *This [reduction of the quantum state] takes place whenever the result
  of an observation enters the consciousness of the observer - or, to be even 
  more painfully precise, my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, 
  all other people being only subjects of my observations.*
>
> &nbsp;...
>
> *However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
  extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
  people, in their hearts, will go along with it.*

[9] I've made sure to run it by a few quantum physicist friends, and also the
online community:

[PhysicsForums](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/on-being-the-sole-observer-in-mwi.926552/#post-5849579)

[Physics StackExchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/387852/has-quantum-solipsism-been-addressed-in-the-mwi-literature)

Nobody has much concrete to say, either in support or objection.

[10] Sometimes it is argued that *any* object, including an unconscious 
detector, is an observer from its own perspective, and so consciousness has 
nothing to do with it. But it's unclear what it means to be "unconscious" and 
still have a "perspective." This is panpsychism in drag; having your cake and 
eating it too.

### Mathematical footnotes: decoherence

This section is for those with some knowledge of QM who want to understand
decoherence as simply as possible.

Consider a qubit in state `|psi> = |0> + |1>` measured with respect to the 
following basis:

   `{ |A> = |0> + |1>, |B> = |0> - |1> }`

Because `<B|psi> = 0`, the result will never be `B`. This result can be 
interpreted as the result of interference. In particular,
`<B|0>` and `<B|1>` (the "two paths" from `|psi>` to `|B>`) have
opposite amplitudes (+1 and -1) and are said to "destructively interfere."

For example, say we have a particle that's spin-down along the z-axis. Note 
that it is in a superposition w.r.t. the x-axis:

   `|phi> = |z-> = sqrt(2)/2 * ( |x+> + |x-> )`

The fact that measuring it in the z-axis will yield a definite result 
(spin-down) even though "it is in a superposition" can be seen as an 
interference effect.

Now let the qubit `|psi>` become entangled with a "measuring device":

   `|psi'> = |0>|X> + |1>|Y>` (with `|X>` and `|Y>` orthornormal).

If you calculate the probability of the left subsystem being measured as `|B>`
and ignoring the second particle (e.g., by applying the projector `P_B @ I`), 
you will find that it is
50%, as would be predicted if the particle were in a *classically*
indeterminate mixture of `|0>` and `|1>`. The interference has
"disappeared" with respect to either sub-system alone. In the density
matrix formulation, this is equivalent to taking the
[partial trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_trace) and
noticing that the off-diagonal terms have disappeared.

On the other hand, because the overall system `|psi'>` is still just a 
superposition (in the tensor-product space spanned by
`{ |0>|X>, |0>|Y>, |1>|X>, |1>|Y> }`),
we can still demonstrate interference on it (e.g., by noting that it
is never measured as `|0>|X> - |1>|Y>`). But this requires control of both
subsystems.

If the second subsystem is a stray photon that is now zipping away at the
speed of light, we have no hope of catching it, and thus the remaining
subsystem appears classical. This is decoherence in a nutshell.

Another interesting thing to note is that the interference on `psi`
disappears only insofar as `|X>` and `|Y>` have a smaller inner product.
In other words, there are *degrees* of entanglement. The more strongly
the particles are entangled -- the more that the second particle's state
gives information about the first's -- the less interference we can
demonstrate.
