### Preface

Quantum Mechanics is weird, but most people don't appreciate exactly why it's
weird or just how weird it is. Those with a New Age bent seem to think that 
electrons must be conscious
to explain the two slit experiment[12]. At the other extreme, many physicists
seem to be of the opinion that consciousness has nothing whatsoever to do with
QM. The truth is somewhere in the middle. To understand it precisely, some
math is needed. Math footnotes are given at the end, but in this piece we try
to communicate the essential point in words.

### Caveat

I am not a physicist, but a software engineer who has some training in quantum
information science. I am far from being an expert, but I can tell you a bit
about density operators on Hilbert space (which is about all the math you'd need
to work this all out yourself). Everything I say in the main section here is,
to the best of my knowledge, accurate and reasonably well-accepted[9]. There
are mathematical footnotes if you feel like going deeper.

As this piece is part of a 
[series on metaphysical idealism](rational-spirituality), I will make some
interpretations that may be hard to swallow. That section is indicated as
speculation.

In a "Schrödinger's Cat"-style experiment, there is a radioactive particle that 
does or does not decay. *Both* possibilities exist together in a 
*superposition*; neither is yet definite. The particle triggers (or does not) a 
device, which then kills (or does not) a cat. Now the particle, device, and cat 
are *together* in a superposition. As more pieces of the world (including 
people) encounter the system, they too join the superposition. You can think of 
the experiment as having two "branches," corresponding to the two possible 
outcomes.

But we never see a world with two "branches"; we only ever see one result or
the other. So what's going on? Maybe the two branches "collapsed" into one
somewhere?

When the experiment is still at the single or few-particle stage, it is easy to
demonstrate the superposition, via an *interference experiment*. That's how
we know that small systems can be in superpositions. But doing so requires that
we can precisely track every particle in the experiment. We've been able
to do this with up to trillions of particles, and have no reason to believe that
there is a fundamental upper limit.

As the experiment grows to entangle with many more objects (including air
molecules and stray photons bouncing away at the speed of light), such control 
quickly becomes impossible *in practice* -- a fact known as *decoherence*. This 
accounts for the loss of interference pattern in the well-known two slit 
experiment, which is not as "spooky" as some would have you believe[12]. 

Because of decoherence, it is practically impossible to *demonstrate* that a
macroscopic system is in a superposition, but crucially, as far as we know, 
**it never becomes impossible *in theory***[0][1] because a growing
superposition continues to exist. So you cannot say that the cat has a 
well-defined fate, because the right experiment would give lie to that claim. 
Both branches still exist, even if you don't have the technology to make them 
interfere.

Yet when *you* encounter the system[2], you never *see* a superposition --
whatever that would mean. You always see one result or the other; the cat
*does* have a single well-defined fate. This is the first point at which the
theory predicts that you *cannot* do an interference experiment even in theory; 
when there is no longer a superposition from your perspective. *You* are the 
point at which the cat's fate becomes definite in the place you call "the 
world."

This is also the first time it has a well-defined *history*: one second ago, 
you couldn't say "the cat is dead," but now you *can* say "one second ago, the 
cat was dead"[3]. To put that in slightly different wording: one second ago the 
cat *wasn't dead*, but now, it *was dead*.

This isn't just a matter of interpretation, either; it has physical 
consequences. At this point it is impossible *even in theory* for you -- *or 
anyone else* -- to demonstrate superposition[4]. Again, this happens precisely 
when *you* encounter it. And what do we mean by "you" here? If your toe "sees"
the result (and the signal hasn't traveled up your leg), you can treat your
toe as an external device just like any other. It just joins the superposition. 
And yet, once the signal reaches "you," the story changes.

Why doesn't this weird everyone out[5]? Because there are a few places it is 
easy to hide the weirdness.

First, because of decoherence, it's easy to pretend that the superposition
disappeared early on, long before it got to you[11]. Even once you accept that
decoherence doesn't solve it[6], it's easy to say "well *something* must have
ended the superposition somehow, somewhere, somewhen, because otherwise WTF."
In fact, this is roughly called the Copenhagen Interpretation, and it has been
the party line for over a century, despite nobody having a clear definition
of it[7].

Second, if we look at this from a "God's-eye perspective," then all that really
happened was that *you* joined the superposition. Both branches still exist,
with one "copy" of you seeing each result. You may see a dead cat, but a copy
of you elsewhere in the multiverse sees a live cat. This is basically the Many 
Worlds Interpretation. But while God may not find any of this strange, it 
doesn't make the situation any less weird for *you.*

From your perspective, you seem to be the sole "observer." In an interesting
(and physically meaningful) sense, *this* world is *your* world[8].

### Some speculation

Everything I've said above is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate and
reasonably well-accepted[9]. Now for some speculation.

Physicists tend to hate attempted associations between QM and consciousness,
but notice that this whole problem exists solely because of the discrepancy
between you seeing *one* result and the math suggesting many. If you try to pin 
down what it means to "see" a result, you will discover yourself trying to make 
precise what it means to be *conscious* of it. In this sense, the problem *is* 
very much about consciousness[10].

It seems I am not the only one who thinks so:

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected
with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that
has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum
mechanics and its applications to the universe.*
>
> &nbsp;...
>
> *Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make
sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the
observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely
uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash
with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics,
and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go
away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.*

> -- Edward Witten, a physicist who colleagues casually call ["head and shoulders above the rest"](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/magazine/a-theory-of-everything.html?pagewanted=all) and "smarter than anyone else."

So here's another way of looking at the problem. According to the philosophy of
Idealism, the whole world is made of mind-stuff. You never encounter *objects*;
you experience colors, textures, etc., and *infer* from them that objects must 
exist. Yet all of what you call "the world" is made entirely of the stuff of
consciousness.

From this perspective, it is hardly surprising that becoming *conscious* of a
result coincides precisely with the coming-into-existence *of* that result:
they are one and the same event. The reason this isn't solipsism (the
philosophy where all of reality is your personal dream) is that, as far as
you can know, the same thing is happening to everyone else from their
perspective as well.

It may seem impossible to prove whether Idealism or Materialism (the philosophy
that the world is made of *stuff*) is true, but this is false. Your world *is*
a dream, and [you can prove this for yourself](new/the_great_mystery.html). 
Until more people do this, the whole thing will remain perplexing.

> *For quantum mechanics, all we really have to do (most people believe) is think about it in the right way. No elaborate experiments necessarily required (although they could help nudge us in the right direction, no doubt about that). But if anything, that makes the embarrassment more acute. All we have to do is wrap our brains around the issue, and yet we’ve failed to do so.*

### Notes and references

[0] Roger Penrose (2004), The Road to Reality, pp. 802-803:

> ...the environmental-decoherence viewpoint ... maintains that state 
vector reduction can be understood as coming about because the
environmental system under consideration becomes inextricably entangled
with its environment.[...] We think of the environment as extremely
complicated and essentially 'random' [... but] **there is no general 
principle providing an absolute bar to extracting information from the 
environment.**[...] Accordingly, such descriptions are referred to as FAPP 
[For All Practical Purposes].

It should be noted that some are looking for "(in-principle) irreversible 
decoherence." See this [interesting paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3796). 
Nonetheless, no such mechanism has been found.

[1] There is also the possibility of "collapse of the wave function," but very
little reason to believe in such a deus-ex-machina. There's very little
experimental support for it, and it's very ugly theoretically (being
nondeterministic and irreversible, unlike the rest of physics).

Note that we have demonstrated superposition for at least trillions of 
(well-controlled) particles. See, e.g. [here](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2010/mar/18/quantum-effect-spotted-in-a-visible-object).
As we do bigger and bigger experiments, the collapse hypothesis becomes less and
less likely.

[2] Either directly or indirectly, such as via a friend telling you, or stray
photons giving you information.

[3] Note the sense in which the history is not a record of what happened,
but a retroactive story to make the present consistent.

[4] At least, in any way that could be shown to you while you still have 
knowledge of the cat's fate. For your perspective to remain consistent, when
you compare notes with anyone else, they will have seen the same result as you.

It is true that someone *outside* the system (i.e., not yet entangled with it)
can still demonstrate superposition, but you are now part of the system they
are experimenting on, and they cannot show you the result without something
like quantum erasure, making you forget the original result.

[5] Or maybe it *does* weird everyone out.

  mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright
  hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.*

[6] [The decoherence myth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

See also [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/374212/118804).

If that is so, why do so many people think that decoherence *has* solved it?
Consider [this quote](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/) from Sean Caroll (bolding mine):

> Once our quantum superposition involves macroscopic systems with **many** degrees of freedom that become entangled with an even-larger environment, the different terms in that superposition proceed to evolve completely independently of each other. It is as if they have become distinct worlds — because they have. We wouldn’t think of our pre-measurement state (1) as describing two different worlds; it’s just one world, in which the particle is in a superposition. But (2) has two worlds in it. The difference is that we can imagine undoing the superposition in (1) by carefully manipulating the particle, but in (2) the difference between the two branches has diffused into the environment and is lost there **forever**. 

How many is "many?" And when has it become truly "forever?" This is a pure
judgement call, unless someone discovers such a thing as in-principle
irreversible decoherence. This is what allows you to pretend that the
superposition disappeared early on.

> *I think Copenhagen is completely ill-defined, and shouldn’t be the favorite anything of any thoughtful person*

[8] Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner was (in)famous for his interpretation that
conscious beings cause collapse, but we can see that he perhaps did it to avoid 
this stranger conclusion (in 1967):

> *This [reduction of the quantum state] takes place whenever the result
  of an observation enters the consciousness of the observer - or, to be even 
  more painfully precise, my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, 
  all other people being only subjects of my observations.*

> &nbsp;...
>
> *However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
  extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
  people, in their hearts, will go along with it.*

[9] I've made sure to run it by a few quantum physicist friends, and also the
online community:

[PhysicsForums](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/on-being-the-sole-observer-in-mwi.926552/#post-5849579)

[Physics StackExchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/387852/has-quantum-solipsism-been-addressed-in-the-mwi-literature)

Nobody has much concrete to say, either in support or objection.

[10] Sometimes it is argued that *any* object, including an unconscious 
detector, is an observer from its own perspective, and so consciousness has 
nothing to do with it. But to say that a detector has a perspective is to say
that it is conscious. Maybe true, maybe false, but it changes nothing for you.

[11] See, for example, this piece of writing in Quanta Magazine (emphasis
mine):

> If you simply stick a cat in a box and link its fate to the outcome of some quantum event, you’re not likely to put it in a superposition of alive and dead, because decoherence **will almost instantly force it into one state or the other**.

As we've discussed, it doesn't force it into one state or the other. The overall
system is still in a superposition, but we are forced to model it as being in an 
unknown-but-definite state (like a classical hidden coin toss) for *practical 
purposes*.

[12] Especially New Age material, like [this scene](https://www.quantamagazine.org/real-life-schrodingers-cats-probe-the-boundary-of-the-quantum-world-20180625/) 
discussing the two slit experiment in the movie "What The Bleep."
 
> *The electron decided to act differently, as though it was aware that it was 
being watched!!*

When a billiard ball moves because it's been struck, does it "decide" to move
because it's "aware" that it's been hit? No. The situation is exactly analogous
here. The electron behaves differently because of a purely physical effect.

But while the electron will not exhibit interference between the two paths, that
does not mean that it has actually taken one path. The electron + detector (+
environment) are still in a superposition, and both branches still exist.

### Mathematical footnotes: decoherence

This section is for those with some knowledge of QM who want to understand
decoherence as simply as possible.

Consider a qubit in state `|psi> = |0> + |1>` measured with respect to the 
following basis:

   `{ |A> = |0> + |1>, |B> = |0> - |1> }`

Because `<B|psi> = 0`, the result will never be `B`. This result can be 
interpreted as the result of interference. In particular,
`<B|0>` and `<B|1>` (the "two paths" from `|psi>` to `|B>`) have
opposite amplitudes (+1 and -1) and are said to "destructively interfere."

For example, say we have a particle that's spin-down along the z-axis. Note 
that it is in a superposition w.r.t. the x-axis:

   `|phi> = |z-> = sqrt(2)/2 * ( |x+> + |x-> )`

The fact that measuring it in the z-axis will yield a definite result 
(spin-down) even though "it is in a superposition" can be seen as an 
interference effect.

Now let the qubit `|psi>` become entangled with a "measuring device":

   `|psi'> = |0>|X> + |1>|Y>` (with `|X>` and `|Y>` orthornormal).

If you calculate the probability of the left subsystem being measured as `|B>`
and ignoring the second particle (e.g., by applying the projector `P_B @ I`), 
you will find that it is
50%, as would be predicted if the particle were in a *classically*
indeterminate mixture of `|0>` and `|1>`. The interference has
"disappeared" with respect to either sub-system alone. In the density
matrix formulation, this is equivalent to taking the
[partial trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_trace) and
noticing that the off-diagonal terms have disappeared.

On the other hand, because the overall system `|psi'>` is still just a 
superposition (in the tensor-product space spanned by
`{ |0>|X>, |0>|Y>, |1>|X>, |1>|Y> }`),
we can still demonstrate interference on it (e.g., by noting that it
is never measured as `|0>|X> - |1>|Y>`). But this requires control of both
subsystems.

If the second subsystem is a stray photon that is now zipping away at the
speed of light, we have no hope of catching it, and thus the remaining
subsystem appears classical. This is decoherence in a nutshell.

Another interesting thing to note is that the interference on `psi`
disappears only insofar as `|X>` and `|Y>` have a smaller inner product.
In other words, there are *degrees* of entanglement. The more strongly
the particles are entangled -- the more that the second particle's state
gives information about the first's -- the less interference we can
demonstrate.
