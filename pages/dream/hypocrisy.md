> But some unresolved emotional issues remained. For a start, I still felt that I had been victimized by this person. I felt hurt. To resolve this, I needed to face all the things this person’s deliberate and ruthless dishonesty had stirred up within my dark side. I succeeded in doing so mainly by looking at examples of situations where I had deliberately lied. Why had I lied? How had I justified it to myself? I kept reflecting on such situations where I had been a liar. Eventually I reached the point where I could clearly see that this person had essentially been doing nothing different from me.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was tied to a tree and burned alive in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt/thought more or less okay about what he was doing. And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual/behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.*
