It is impossible to prove that the past really happened. For all you know, you
and the world popped into existence, fully formed, just now. Even stranger, [it
is not even rationally justified to say that a real past is more *likely*](past.html). 
Put another way, it is not meaningfully "unlikely" that the past is an illusion.

Similarly, [it is not "likely" that the laws of physics will continue to operate
five seconds from now](future.html). 
Even though the sun has come up millions of times before,
we are not logically justified in believing that it is more likely to come over 
the horizon tomorrow than, say, a merry band of monkeys.

 Go ahead and digest that for a moment.

*Materialism* is the philosophy that says that the world is fundamentally made
of *stuff*, and *idealism* says that reality is *mental* (not unlike a dream).
Like with time, [it is not meaningful](solipsism.html) to call one possibility 
more "likely" than the other, without relying on untestable assumptions. It may 
*feel* more logical to believe in the past, future, space, and matter, but this 
is an illusion. The decision is [pure preference](emotional.html).

Note that none of this ought to change with more science or better technology.
If anything, our [scientists](http://www.businessinsider.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-thinks-the-universe-might-be-a-simulation-2016-12) 
and [technologists](https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation) 
are becoming *more* convinced that we're in a simulation or the like.

It is obviously more *practical* to take time and matter seriously, and as
a result we believe that we ought to take them *literally*. But something
truly remarkable happens when you learn to separate these two modes of
belief (the practical and the literal). I'll try to communicate the faintest
whiff of what that something is, recognizing that it will likely sound like 
nonsense from where you currently stand.

Notice the splendor of sights and sounds that presently surround you. They
probably seem like nothing special. The reason they feel mundane is that deep 
down, you're sure you can explain what's causing them: photons, photoreceptors,
neurotransmitters, etc. Even if you don't know any of the science, you know
that you have seen and heard stuff *before*, so there's nothing very special
about any of it happening *now*. What's the big deal?

Now this next point is delicate to convey. Recall that, as far as you can *ever*
know, none of that stuff is actually *true* -- or even *likely*. There is a 
subtle but meaningful sense in which your experience is *unexplainable*, and if 
you could see it, you would be overcome with a profound awe, gratitude, wonder, 
joy, and love quite unlike anything that is possible from *within* your
metaphysical strictures.

That statement is likely to strike a nerve. To call something "unexplainable"
sounds like an invitation to religion. Certainly science offers enough meaning
that we shouldn't have to resort to celebrations of ignorance. But the species
of insight provoked by the realization in question is entirely distinct from 
those offered by science, and worthwhile in its own right. It is uniquely 
*transcendent*, in that it transcends your whole worldview. And while it can, 
incidentally, offer a genuine glimpse into the essence of religion, it is 
possible (if difficult) to arrive there using nothing more than careful 
reasoning and profound honesty.

Again, recognize that you *cannot* know -- *with any certainty at all* -- what
is causing the marvelous display before you; nor even that it has ever happened
before. Now notice that regardless of how well you intellectually comprehend
this, some part of your mind is *dead certain* anyway. When that aspect of your 
mind confronts its own profound disingenuity, and releases its unjustified 
stranglehold, something completely unexpected happens.

I'm not being coy on purpose. That "something unexpected" is very hard to put 
into words, which is why contemplatives across the ages have resorted to riddles 
and poetry. I'll share one of my favorites, from Tibetan Buddhism:

> *So close you can't see it*
>
> *So deep you can't fathom it*
>
> *So simple you can't believe it*
>
> *So good you can't accept it*

The ability to undermine your metaphysics has another benefit. We've already
seen that we cannot *disprove* the hypothesis that this is all a dream. But if
it *is* a dream -- and in particular, *your* dream -- then perhaps there is a
way to *prove* it.

The idea goes like this. If this is your dream, then in some way, your own mind
is responsible for the remarkable internal consistency and stability of the
apparent world. In other words, materialism is true *because you make it true.*
But, as in a nighttime dream, the mental mechanisms that generate the world's 
dynamics lie outside your normal conscious access. That is why you cannot simply 
will a million dollars into your bank account now, for example.

But it is possible to become *lucid* -- that is, to wake up *into* the dream.
This begins to reveal insights into its nature. With continued practice, it 
becomes possible to unravel the dream, discovering very precisely how (and why) 
every little detail and law is constructed. One can then "re-ravel" it *in any 
way that one sees fit* -- perhaps choosing to make the dream character forget 
about the whole process. This allows the character to enjoy the dream with 
abandon, never even suspecting the astonishingly clever ruse.

According to various contemplative traditions, that is basically where you find
yourself now. And there is a way to verify this, unlike with materialism, where
you must forever remain suspicious about whether you are in a dream or simulation.
Of course, this dream is *far* more intricate than the kind you have at night,
but the mechanism behind its operation is fundamentally the same.

Waiting for others to prove this, or for external verification, is futile. If
you really want to test the possibility that this world is your dream, you will
have to profoundly undermine the deep layers that give rise to its dynamics and
see what happens. As you may have already guessed, one way to do this is to
powerfully confront the illogic of your metaphysical assumptions. This can
interrupt the processes that use those assumptions to generate your mundane,
well-behaved world.

This also offers insight into why it's so hard to subvert your metaphysics: if 
this actually *were* your dream, would you *really* want to know it?

---

If this all sounds crazy, it is for good reason. If you were to see too much,
too soon, you may indeed [go crazy](insanity.html). The main risk is in
misunderstanding whose dream, exactly, this is. We've already said it is *your*
dream, but there's a subtlety here.

Consider a nighttime dream, where your character may have very little in common
with your waking self.
If she were told the dream came from *her* mind, she would rightly object. But
in another sense it's true: what is "looking out her eyes" is *you*, the
dreamer. So it *is* her dream, but not in the way she might expect.

In a similar way, although this is *your* dream, "you" does not refer to the
dream character you normally identify with. Yet if you were to turn precisely
inward, toward the seeming void from which your thoughts arise -- in the
direction you know instinctively as "I" -- you might indeed discover *That which
dreams realities into existence*. Or rather, it might rediscover itself.

You are the Buddha, trying to wake up. Other names people have used across the
ages are God; the primordial life force; or unconditional, universal love. It's
hard to describe without sounding nutty. But whatever you call it (or not, 
since we're trying to *avoid* metaphysical baggage), it points to something 
meaningful and worth discovering for yourself.

---

The Buddha -- what you fundamentally are -- is not a person or entity. This
part is the hardest to communicate, so I'll only give a brief sketch.

Notice that what you call "the world" is entirely 
[your own mind](consciousness.html).
It is easy to understand this intellectually, but that's not very impactful
while part of your mind is still certain that there's also a "real world" that's
the *cause* of this mental world. As before, you don't have to believe that
there's *not*, but something interesting happens when you stop pretending to
know that there *is*.

As described in the above-linked piece, there is nobody sitting inside your head 
looking out at the dream. Instead, the dream is *experiencing itself.* The 
process of awakening is not about *you* waking up. It is about the luminosity
waking up from the illusion of being a separate self. "Buddha" is the very 
self-aware "fabric" that conjures itself into the shape you call "reality."

I told you it would be hard to describe. I'm not sure I can do any better here.

What about other people? How do they fit into all this?

---

The question of intersubjectivity is hardest to answer. What's been written so
far sounds like solipsism (the form of idealism that says this is all your 
*personal* dream), but it's not quite.

The closest analogy I can find is the many worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics. In it (or at least, in one formulation of it), when you encounter the
result of an experiment that has more than one potential outcome, *all* of the 
outcomes happen. In a sense, you split into multiple copies, each inhabiting
a distinct world (corresponding to the possible outcomes).

From your perspective, this "splitting" only happens with you, personally; you
are the sole "observer" in your world, in a way that is [*physically
verifiable* in principle](quantum-woo.html). Yet there's no reason
to believe that the same isn't happening for other people or objects, too, from
their own perspective. In this way, the world you experience is particular to
you, and yet this doesn't imply that you are the only observer in the
multiverse, as it were. Put another way: what you call "the world" is entirely
*your* dream, but that doesn't mean there aren't others.

I'm not trying to suggest that QM should be used to *support* any of what I've 
written above, but the analogy may be useful.

You may be thinking that all of the above can be perfectly well accommodated
by the materialist framework -- except, perhaps, for the suggestion that the 
very "laws of nature" are malleable (which you quite reasonably regard as
nonsense). And nothing I say can (or should) convince you otherwise.

Yet even if you don't take any of it seriously, you are still left with the
conundrum mentioned at the beginning of this piece. If you are honest with
yourself, you will discover that you have no reason to take your metaphysical
beliefs literally, and yet part of you can't seem to help it. This really ought 
to prompt you to discover what happens when you confront this discrepancy with 
every ounce of sincerity you have. Don't settle for "I can't help it."

The Buddha more or less claims -- and I'm inclined to agree -- that when you
finally do this, you will discover all of the above, and infinitely more.
