Rational spirituality: transcending your metaphysics

---

It is impossible to prove that the past really happened. For all you know, you
and the world popped into existence, fully formed, just now. Even stranger, it
is not even rationally justified to say that a real past is *likely* -- or,
contrariwise, that an unreal past is *unlikely*.

Similarly, it is not "likely" that the laws of physics will continue to operate
five seconds from now. Even though the sun has come up millions of times before,
we are not rationally justified in saying that it is more likely to come over
the horizon tomorrow than a merry band of monkeys.

Go ahead and digest that for a moment.

*Materialism* is the philosophy that says that the world is fundamentally made
of *stuff*, and *idealism* says that reality is *mental* (not unlike a dream).
Like with time, it is not meaningful to call one possibility more "likely" than
the other without relying on untestable assumptions.

Note that none of this ought to change with more science or better technology.
If anything, our scientists and technologists are becoming *more* convinced
that we're in a simulation or similar.

It is obviously more *practical* to take time and matter seriously, and as
a result we believe that we might as well take them *literally*. But something
truly remarkable happens when you learn to separate these two modes of
belief (the practical and the literal). I'll try to communicate the faintest
whiff of what it is, recognizing that it will likely sound like nonsense from
where you currently stand.

Notice the splendor of sights and sounds that presently surround you. They
probably seem like nothing special. The reason for that is that deep down,
you're sure you can explain what's causing them: photons, photoreceptors,
neurotransmitters, etc. Even if you don't know any of the science, you know
that you have seen and heard stuff *before*, so there's nothing very unusual
about any of it happening *now*. What's the big deal?

This next point is delicate to convey. Recall that, as far as you can *ever*
know, none of that stuff is actually *true*. There is a meaningful sense in
which your experience is *unexplainable*, and if you could perceive that 
clearly, you would be overcome with a profound awe, gratitude, wonder, and joy 
unlike anything that is possible from *within* the constraints of your 
metaphysical belief structure.

That statement is likely to strike a nerve. To call something "unexplainable"
may sound like an invitation to religion. Certainly science offers enough awe
that we shouldn't have to resort to celebrations of ignorance. But while the
realization we're trying to trigger can, incidentally, give a genuine glimpse 
into the essence of religion, it is possible to arrive there using nothing more 
than careful reasoning and profound honesty. Yet the species of insight it 
provokes is entirely distinct from those offered by science.

Again, recognize that you *cannot* know -- *with any certainty at all* -- what
is causing the marvelous display before you; nor even that it has ever happened
before. Now notice that regardless of how well you intellectually comprehend
this, some part of your mind is *dead certain* anyway. When that aspect of your 
mind deeply releases its unjustified stranglehold, something completely 
unexpected happens.

I'm not being coy on purpose. That "something" is very hard to put into words, 
which is why contemplatives across the ages have resorted to riddles and 
poetry. This is one of my favorites:

> So close you can't see it
>
> So deep you can't fathom it
>
> So simple you can't believe it
>
> So good you can't accept it
>

The ability to undermine your metaphysics has another benefit. Consider the
hypothesis that what you call "reality" is, in fact a dream -- in particular,
*your* dream. The apparent internal consistency and stability are then the 
result of your own deep cognitive processes.

How would you test this hypothesis?

Waiting for others to prove it would be futile. So would wishing for a million
dollars and failing to have it materialize: you have no more ability to believe
that such a thing is possible than you do to *disbelieve* in a real past. Like
an iceberg, the vast majority of your mind is submerged and inaccessible to you.

If you really wanted to test the possibility that this world is your dream,
you would have to radically undermine the deep layers that give rise to its 
apparent normalcy.

This also offers insight into why it's so hard to subvert those layers: if this
actually *were* your dream, would you really want to know it?

Notice the splendor of colors and sounds happening all around you. Now
notice that you are subconsciously filling in all sorts of details about their
nature and relationship to you. You don't just hear "whoosh," you also think
"that's a car about 30 feet on my right." The hearing and thinking get woven
together so intimately that they become one thing: you simply *hear a car*.

But as we've seen, there's no way to *know* that there's really a car out there.
And yet, whether there's "really" a car or not seems to be irrelevant: if you
step out into traffic, something bad will happen, and so you might as well *say*
that there is "really" a car there.

But is there a way to take the car as a *practical* truth without taking it as
*literal* truth? And is there any value in doing so? The answer to both is a 
resounding *yes.* Let's use our belief in *time* as an example.

To keep this short, I'll give only a brief overview of other places where your
metaphysical baggage may weigh down your perception.

Pick a sound and listen to it. Notice that the experience you call "sound" is 
happening entirely within your own mind. In a sense, sound is ["made of"
*mind-stuff*](consciousness.html). I'm not trying to give you a new metaphysical
belief, but point to something. Notice that everything you call "the world" is, 
in this sense, simply your own mind manifesting in a myriad of ways.

Look around and say out loud: "this is all my own mind." Try to really 
appreciate this.

Notice how naturally you assume that there is also a "real world" somewhere that
is the *cause* of this mental manifestation. Notice also how seamlessly you
assume that where there is a *mind* there must be a *brain*. I am not going to
try to convince you that those are *wrong*, but as before, something unexpected 
and beautiful happens when you genuinely confront the fact that those 
assumptions are profoundly unjustified.

Again, you don't have to *start* believing in anything weird; you only need to
*stop* pretending that you know things that you don't.

The most important realization is hardest to communicate.

We normally feel like we are a "self" sitting inside a head, looking out at
the world.
