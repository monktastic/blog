Have you ever had the experience of reading a book, only to discover that your
eyes are still scanning the page but your mind is elsewhere? If you're
interrupted mid-reverie, chances are you can recall the past few seconds of
thought. Those thoughts were not really *outside* of consciousness and yet,
somehow, you weren't really *noticing* them either.

You very likely spend the vast majority of your day in such a semi-conscious 
state. You may have a hard time believing this, because the mind readily
back-fills a sense of presence even when there was none. It's a little bit
like your [visual blind spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision)): 
to find it, you have to know how to look.

When you begin to meditate, you see for yourself just how busy your mind is,
in a way that normally escapes your notice. You discover that *most* of your 
thoughts occupy this "conscious but not noticed" limbo.

Once you learn to notice this raging river of thoughts, a lot of your mood and
personality can be understood on a level that is simply not possible otherwise. 
This accounts for the commonly recognized benefits of meditation.

If you decide to progress on the path, this mindlessness starts happening less 
and less. As you become more present, you begin to detect an undercurrent of
ever more subtle thoughts flowing between the big, coarse ones. When even these 
quieten, and you're sitting in a seemingly thought-free state, you might 
consider yourself basically free of thought.

But are you really?

If you still feel like a self sitting in a world of space and time, it's because
there's still a layer of your mind you have not yet penetrated.

This is where most meditators get stuck. It's easy to think that meditation is
about sitting in peaceful stillness, but that's only the start.

If you look *very carefully*, you will discover that you never actually
experience the passage of time. You only ever experience a single moment.
Woven into this moment is a bit of experience that you *infer* to be "the past." 
This inference normally happens so subtly and seamlessly that you scarcely 
notice it.

You could say that it happens subconsciously, but only in the same sense that
mind wandering is subconscious. It's perfectly *accessible* to consciousness;
we just don't have the skills to notice it yet. Because it happens well below
your conscious threshold, it feels like time is happening *to* you, when really
you are *doing* it. You are not passively *experiencing* time; you are actively 
*generating* that illusion.

You are not "continually" generating it, either. You only do it in *this*
moment. You might say that you are born fresh in each moment, but this implies 
that there is a constant "you" moving across time. Instead, it would be more 
accurate to say that *this* is the first (and only) moment you are alive. Now, 
now, now; fresh, fresh, *fresh*. More accurate still would be to utterly
abandon the notion of other moments.

I cannot convince you of this, and even if 
I could, the intellectual understanding would do you very little good.

Time is not the only inference you are making. When you hear a sound, that
sound is occurring *inside* your mind. Experientially, it happens in exactly the
same place it would if this were a nighttime dream. But you *infer* it to be
coming from outside your mind, and so it *feels* like the sound is happening
outside your mind, "over there." Again, *it only feels like this because your
attention isn't precise enough to catch the trick.*

In reality, all you ever experience is your own mind. Through a rapid series
of subconscious inferences, you project that experience out and think of it as
"the world out there."

Author, meditator, and neuroscientist Culadasa (John Yates) points out:

> By observing the nature of the mind in both its active and passive states, it eventually becomes clear that *all* objects of consciousness are *constructs of the mind*. All we’ve ever known is what the mind itself has produced. The true nature of these mind-made objects of consciousness is simply the nature of mind itself. You may have already grasped this intellectually, but you now experience it directly. True, there may have been some external stimulus that caused your unconscious sub-minds to project a particular object into consciousness, but all we can ever observe is the *mental* object, a *product* of the mind itself—not the source of the original stimulus. To put it another way, the “thing-in-itself” that stimulated the mind to produce the object *can never be observed*. The mind creates its own “reality,” made entirely of cognitive-emotional constructs produced in response to unknown, and ultimately unknowable, forces acting on the mind through the senses.

Can you look around and (honestly) recognize: "this is all my own mind"? Pick
up an object and say "this is my own mind." 
Regardless of whether there is a "real world" somewhere, causing all of this,
all of *this* is your mind. The more clearly you see this, the less you will
worry about a hypothetical and unfalsifiable other world.

Culadasa continues:

> It’s especially important not to be deceived by mere intellectual understanding. You may think you “got it” just by reading this description. However, many philosophers and scientists have understood this truth intellectually, but it hasn’t transformed them. We haven’t gotten it until this Insight completely transforms the way we perceive the world—especially during challenging times, like when we’re in an argument with our boss or partner, in a traffic jam, or when our house burns down.
