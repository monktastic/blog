title: The world is your mind
description:

If you look *very carefully*, you will discover that you never actually
experience the passage of time. You only ever experience a single moment.
Woven into this moment is a bit of experience that you *infer* to be "the past." 
This inference normally happens so subtly and seamlessly that you scarcely 
notice it.

You could say that it happens subconsciously, but only in the same sense that
mindless reading is subconscious. It's perfectly *accessible* to consciousness;
we just don't have the skills to notice it yet. Because it happens well below
your conscious threshold, it feels like time is happening *to* you, when really
you are *doing* it. You are not passively *experiencing* time; you are actively 
*generating* that illusion.

You are not "continually" generating it, either. You only do it in *this*
moment. You might say that you are born fresh in each moment, but this implies 
that there is a constant "you" moving across time. Instead, it would be more 
accurate to say that *this* is the first (and only) moment you are alive. Now, 
now, now; fresh, fresh, *fresh*. More accurate still would be to utterly
abandon the notion of other moments.

I cannot convince you of this, and even if 
I could, the intellectual understanding would do you very little good.

Time is not the only inference you are making. When you hear a sound, that
sound is occurring *inside* your mind. Experientially, it happens in exactly the
same "place" it would if this were a nighttime dream. But you *infer* it to be
coming from outside your mind, and so it *feels* like the sound is happening
outside your mind, "over there." Again, *it only feels like this because your
attention isn't precise enough to catch the trick.* 

Put another way: you don't just *believe* it comes from outside (which may or 
may not be true), you *feel* it. And this *feeling* is the result of a trick
that you are pulling on yourself and can learn to see through.

In reality, all you ever experience is your own mind. Through a rapid series
of subconscious inferences, you project that experience out and think of it as
"the world out there." Thus it begins to *feel* like a "world out there."

Author, meditator, and neuroscientist Culadasa (John Yates) points out:

> By observing the nature of the mind in both its active and passive states, it eventually becomes clear that *all* objects of consciousness are *constructs of the mind*. All we’ve ever known is what the mind itself has produced. The true nature of these mind-made objects of consciousness is simply the nature of mind itself. You may have already grasped this intellectually, but you now experience it directly. True, there may have been some external stimulus that caused your unconscious sub-minds to project a particular object into consciousness, but all we can ever observe is the *mental* object, a *product* of the mind itself—not the source of the original stimulus. To put it another way, the “thing-in-itself” that stimulated the mind to produce the object *can never be observed*. The mind creates its own “reality,” made entirely of cognitive-emotional constructs produced in response to unknown, and ultimately unknowable, forces acting on the mind through the senses.

Can you look around and (honestly) recognize: "this is all my own mind"? Pick
up an object and say "*this* is my own mind." 
Regardless of whether there is a "real world" somewhere, causing all of this,
all of **this** is your mind. The more clearly you see this, the less you will
worry about a hypothetical and unfalsifiable other world.

Culadasa continues:

> It’s especially important not to be deceived by mere intellectual understanding. You may think you “got it” just by reading this description. However, many philosophers and scientists have understood this truth intellectually, but it hasn’t transformed them. We haven’t gotten it until this Insight completely transforms the way we perceive the world—especially during challenging times, like when we’re in an argument with our boss or partner, in a traffic jam, or when our house burns down.
