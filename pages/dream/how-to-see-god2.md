The question of whether God "exists" or "does not exist" is a red herring: "existence" is a metaphysical concept that is much harder to pin down than you might imagine. Instead, by transcending your metaphysical structure entirely, you can enter a mode of apprehension that clarifies the confusion at the heart of the question. Such a mode is provably impossible or nonsensical according to your current metaphysics, which is what prevents you from bothering to discover it.

I will try to give the faintest hint of what this mode is. I recognize it will not overcome many of the objections you might have, but I trust that if even a wisp gets through, you will be inspired to address them yourself.

If you could perceive the sense in which *this* is the first (and possibly *only*) moment of existence, you would be overcome by awesome glory and wondrous splendor so profound that you literally cannot imagine it -- your imagination itself being constrained by your worldview. Having glimpsed this even once, you would begin to detect a particular ruse your mind has been pulling, constricting its perception and understanding based on a very shaky foundation.

I'm not saying it is easy to have this perception, but it is easy to explain intellectually.

First, notice that there is no way to prove that the past really happened. Harder to understand is that we are not even logically justified in saying that it is "likely." Put another way: it is not "unlikely" that the past is an illusion. For a similar reason, it is not "likely" that the laws of physics will continue to operate in the future. It is not "unlikely" that everything will suddenly go haywire. In this way you can see that you take *very seriously indeed* things for which you have no logical justification.

It is hard to avoid thinking of these as mere philosophical oddities: so what if we can't justify these things; obviously they are real anyway! But this is a deflection: the question isn't whether they're true or not, but why we are so viscerally certain of things for which we
admittedly have no justification. Perhaps you will argue that it is far more *practical* to believe, but you've never seriously tried the alternative, and part of you really doesn't want to. It *is* possible to stop taking your assumptions *literally* while still using them *practically*, but this takes a great deal of honesty.

One approximation people commonly make is to think it's about "being in the now." That sounds rather Zen, doesn't it? The problem is that the very concept "now" is only meaningful as a dividing line between a past and a future, which means that you're still at least subtly holding onto those as real. This is trying to have your enlightenment cake and eat it, too. It's infinitely close, but still infinitely far. Something much more radical is necessary.

The reason it's so hard to let go is because your very conception of who you are depends intimately on the reality of time. Thus, giving up the concreteness of time is akin to dying. Obviously the mind will fight that with every tool in its arsenal. But that's only because it literally cannot fathom what lies beyond.

This next part is even harder to convey, but I will try.

Pay close attention to a sound. Notice that the experience called "sound" happens in your mind. Forget about the idea of "brains" for a moment. You might say that sounds happen in your experiential field. More poetically, we might say that the intrinsic luminosity of your mind is manifesting *as* that sound. See if you can get an intuitive sense of this. It is as though there is a latent *potentiality* called "mind" or "consciousness" that manifests *as* particular experiences. Now turn your attention to your other sensory fields and notice the same for them. Proceeding in this way, notice that the entire phenomenon you call "the world" is made entirely of your own mind. Look around and say out loud "*this* is my mind."

You will find it hard to avoid translating this into your metaphysics: "Oh, he means my neurons are firing, giving me my personal experience of the world. Obviously there are real objects out there." I'm not trying to prove this idea *wrong*, but this subtle conflation will cause you to miss the point. As with time, try to confront the fact that belief in a physical reality (including brains) is ultimately a *choice*, and not supported in the way you normally assume. If you do so *very honestly*, you may begin to perceive the sense in which you've only ever interacted with your own mind.

The next question is: whose mind is this? We've already said that it's *yours*, but there's a subtlety here.

In a nighttime dream, you embody a character who may be arbitrarily different from your waking self. She's not you. And yet, in another sense, she *is* you: if she were to [trace her thoughts back](find-the-dreamer.html) toward the apparent void from which they arise -- in the direction she experiences as "I" -- she would discover *you*. Or rather, you would rediscover yourself. In one sense, she is right to say "this dream isn't *my* mind," but in another sense, she's wrong.

In a similar way, this is your dream, but "you" does not refer to the dream character you normally take yourself to be. And just as nobody could convince your nighttime dream character of such a ludicrous thing, nobody will convince you of it here, either. It would be a mistake to even try.

Nonetheless, through careful reasoning and introspection, it is possible to discover a meaningful sense in which both the world and your character are manifestations of that "glory" and "splendor" that transcend your personal self. What's more, if this really is a dream -- your dream -- then remaining in this mode of perception might actually influence the behavior of the dream in ways that can begin to reveal heretofore hidden insights about its nature.
