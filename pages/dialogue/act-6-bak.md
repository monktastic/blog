  I’d read about years before, John Wheeler, was actually a professor there. So
  I went and read some of his newer papers, in which he was talking about “law
  without law.” He’d say things like, “In the end, the only law is that
  there is no law.” There’s no ultimate law of physics. All the laws of
  physics are mutable and that mutability itself is a principle of physics. He’d
  say, there’s no law of physics that hasn’t been transcended. I saw this, and
  I remembered my joke about how the laws of physics must be wrong, and I was
  immensely attracted to this idea that maybe ultimately there actually are no
  laws of physics. What there is in place of laws, I didn’t know. But if the
  laws weren’t 100 percent trustworthy, maybe there was a back door to the
  stars.*

### Act 6: Emptiness

**Alice**: Earlier you said that your worldview *briefly* crumbles
when you ponder alternate ones. Why only briefly?

**Bob**: Psychological pressure forces the original beliefs to return
very rapidly. It's as though my worldview has a powerful self-healing
mechanism.

**Alice**: This is an important insight! This mechanism is *precisely*
what prevents your worldview from being suspended for long enough to
adopt a perspective that would provide the evidence you seek.

**Bob**: So what you're telling me is that I have to go crazy *first*,
and then I'll start seeing crazy things. Awesome. What are the monthly
dues for your church again?

**Alice**: Oh it's much less costly than your current church, believe
me!

But you don't have to start believing anything. In fact, *belief*
is the very problem. You just have to be willing to loosen your
stranglehold for long enough to let a little light in.

Let me ask you this: what's wrong with the world?

B: Where do I even begin? Global warming, wealth inequality, racism,
sexism, civil war, consumerism....

A: Great. And what's causing all that?

B: People. Especially fat cat CEOs, corrupt politicians, elite bankers.
Humans are selfish and greedy.

A: Is that all we are?

B: No, we have a dual nature. But the evil part is winning.

A: Have you ever seen this dual nature up close and personal? Perhaps
with someone in your own life?

B: Sure. Sometimes my wife seems angelic, and other times... well, I'd
better not say, just in case she's listening.

A: Haha, smart. Okay, have you ever had an experience where you deeply
released a grudge against her?

B: Yes, we've had some cathartic moments.

A: Why do you say "we"?

B: Well when I forgave her from the bottom of my heart, she blossomed.
It was as though that particular ... less angelic ... part of her was
erased.

A: Would you say it was... *quantum erased?*

B: I know you're just yanking my chain, but there are some interesting
parallels I want to think about later.

But I think straightforward classical mechanisms suffice to explain
this. What does it have to do with collecting evidence for your far-out
hypothesis?

A: Well, we're looking for evidence of something like this: your healing
*is* the world's healing. They are mirror images of the same process.
What would good evidence look like to you?

B: I would expect that as my own emotional baggage is shed, the world
improves in objective ways.

A: It could still just be a coincidence, right?

B: Depends on the size of the effect.

**Alice**: In a mild form, it would look like your inability to fit an
experience into your worldview. In a stronger form, you might be tempted
to call it a "miracle."

B: Oh no, don't tell me you believe in miracles.

A: I said you'd be tempted to *call* it one. Because of the self-healing
mechanism you described, and the fact that your world is a reflection of
your worldview, *your world itself* has a rapid self-healing property.
Apparent contradictions are quickly resolved.

B: So the laws of physics wouldn't be broken. Sounds like pretty poor
evidence to me.

A: Well, every time you witness a "miracle" is a "red pill / blue pill"
moment. You've been choosing the blue pill every time -- stuffing any
inconsistencies into your default metaphysics -- and so yes, the result
is that everything continues as "normal." Not only that, but the
"miracles" on offer have become correspondingly weaker.

B: Right, and if I take the red pill, then the laws of physics change
to accommodate my broadened perspective or something. Honestly, this all
sounds a little loony to me. I've never experienced a miracle, and I
don't intend to start believing in them just to test out your
cockamamie theory.

A: Luckily you don't have to.

---

**Bob**: Or for long enough to go crazy and *believe* that there is
good evidence.

**Alice**: You only think that your current view is rational and sane
because you haven't looked very carefully. This is why the insight about
time is so incisive. The more logic you apply to it, the more clearly
the lie of rationality is revealed.

**Bob**: But if I stopped believing in time, my life would fall apart.

**Alice**: How do you know? The closest you've come is *pretending*
that it doesn't exist. Obviously that would be a bad life choice. Not
only that, but it is possible to have a *functional* belief in time
without taking it *literally.*

**Bob**: So what happens if I actually stop?

**Alice**: There's still too big of a gap from where you are to describe
it to you. Let's start with something easier than time, though it's
ultimately very related.

Suppose I told you that by deeply forgiving someone -- more deeply than
you've had the courage to do so far -- that it might undo whatever pain
it is inside of them that caused them to behave the way they had?

**Bob**: That doesn't sound very mystical. Obviously our emotions affect
other people.

**Alice**: Good. Can you see that before, during, and after your usual 
attempts at forgiveness, you are holding tightly to this worldview? 
Specifically, one in which you are two separate people; that she is 
someone who has done wrong; that any possible healing must be done via
your sanctioned mechanisms?

**Bob**: Sure, but all of that stuff is *true*.

**Alice**: See what happens if you deeply release all of that. For example,
you might adopt the half-way realization that you never really see
another person; you only see your mental image of them. Next, perhaps
you can completely release the idea that they've done *wrong*. For
example, you might reflect on the possibility that they were doing their
best at the time. And release any sense of limitation on how much
healing is possible for both of you. Feel love so overwhelming that
you are brought to tears.

**Bob**: That sounds beautiful. But why would it prove anything?

**Alice**: You may not get "proof" in one fell swoop. Instead, something
in your life may heal in such a way that you're unsure of whether it fits
entirely within your worldview. That point is another red pill / blue pill
moment. You don't have to go Full Woo and believe in the Magic of Love.
But you might be inspired to loosen your stranglehold on the world.

If you do, maybe you find more opportunities for healing, and perhaps
they push your boundaries a little more each time....

**Bob**: I don't understand. Push my boundaries on *what?* What will
the evidence *look like?*

**Alice**: On how the world "can" and "cannot" work. On your ability
to see that your perspective of the world *is* the
world. That what you do in your mind, you do in the world. The evidence
will look like a world that heals in a way that reflects your own
healing.
