>*When [Rechungpa] returned to Tibet after many years, his old master
  Milarepa came to welcome him on a barren plateau. After they had exchanged
  greetings and discussed Rechungpa's studies for some time, a violent
  hailstorm suddenly broke from out of the sky. There was nowhere to hide in
  the flat open plain. Milarepa spotted a yak horn on the ground and quickly
  took refuge inside of it -- without the horn becoming larger or Milarepa
  becoming smaller. From his dry shelter, Milarepa sang a song letting
  Rechungpa know that there was still plenty of space in the yak horn... if
  only his student had realized the nature of emptiness.*

>*You might think that the story of Milarepa's yak horn is merely a fairy
  tale. Or, if you are the credulous type, you might believe that it was a
  case of sorcery performed by the Tibetan yogi. But it is neither, as we
  will see.*

### Act 1: The Fairground

Alice and Bob are walking through an art fair. They stop to appreciate
the brilliance of an art piece. Is it two giraffes or an elephant?

**Alice**: It depends on which way you look at it.

**Bob**: Right. In some sense it is both, and in another sense, neither.

**Alice**: In a way, it's similar to reality. What reality *is* depends
on how you *perceive* it.

**Bob**: Of course, there's a limit. Just as with the sculpture, you can
choose to *see* the world in different ways, but ultimately the
underlying reality restricts how you can *interact* with it.

**Alice**: Are you *sure* of that?

**Bob**: *[Spits out coffee]* What? Explain yourself.

**Alice**: Well, what if the sculpture analogy ultimately breaks down?
What if your perspective on reality *is* reality? What if there were a
way to "rotate" reality -- or rotate yourself *through* reality, if you
prefer -- in such a way that *seeing* an elephant allowed you to
*interact* with it?

**Bob**: In other words, what if by changing our perspective on reality,
we could change reality itself? In an *objectively verifiable* way?

**Alice**: That's the general idea, yes.

**Bob**: Then all of science would be disproved, and obviously that
hasn't happened, so... [QED, bitches](https://xkcd.com/622/)!

**Alice**: Haha, you got me, old chap!

*Bob pulls out a pipe to celebrate.*
