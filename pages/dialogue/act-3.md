### Act 3: Layers of mind

**Bob**: Wow, that was remarkable.

**Alice**: What did you learn?

**Bob**: At first, it seemed easy to pay attention to the breath. Then, after
some days of nonstop practice, I noticed that my attention seemed to
be getting *worse*. I was being interrupted by thoughts all the time!

**Alice**: Why would your attention become worse by meditating?

**Bob**: Turns out it didn't. I merely began *noticing* how busy my mind had
always been. Once that layer of nonstop internal monologue calmed down
after some weeks, I discovered there were more layers beneath!

**Alice**: Such as?

**Bob**: Subtle thoughts about how I was feeling. I understand so much more
about myself -- about my mood and personality, for example -- than I
could ever have hoped to before. And now that I see that we're *all*
neurotic in this way, it's *so much easier* to be kind.

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle*
> -- Philo of Alexandria

**Alice**: That sounds wonderful! So, are you done? Have you attained
enlightenment?

**Bob**: I don't know. I am able to sit in a very peaceful state, with my
mind lucid and unmoving. Does that count?

**Alice**: So it still feels like you are an individual located in space and
time doing something called "meditation."

**Bob**: Of course, why wouldn't it?

**Alice**: You are far from done. You have not even penetrated the layer of
mind that gives rise to the illusion of physical reality.

**Bob**: I don't like where you are going with this. What do you mean
"the illusion of?"

**Alice**: Let me ask you: *why* do you believe in time?

*Bob becomes pensive.*
