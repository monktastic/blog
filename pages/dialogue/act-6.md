> *[Wheeler would] say things like, “In the end, the only law is that
  there is no law.” There’s no ultimate law of physics. All the laws of
  physics are mutable and that mutability itself is a principle of physics. He’d
  say, there’s no law of physics that hasn't been transcended. I saw this, and
  I remembered my joke about how the laws of physics must be wrong, and I was
  immensely attracted to this idea that maybe ultimately there actually are no
  laws of physics. What there is in place of laws, I didn't know. But if the
  laws weren't 100 percent trustworthy, maybe there was a back door to the
  stars.*

### Interlude

**Alice**: Earlier you said that your worldview *briefly* crumbles when
you confront certain facts. Why only briefly?

**Bob**: Immense psychological pressure forces the original beliefs to
return very rapidly. It's as though my worldview has a powerful
self-healing mechanism.

**Alice**: This is an important insight! This mechanism is *precisely*
what prevents your worldview from being suspended for long enough to
adopt the perspective that would provide the evidence you seek.

**Bob**: So what you're telling me is that I have to go crazy *first*,
and then I'll start seeing crazy things. Awesome. What are the monthly
dues for your church again?

**Alice**: Oh it's much less costly than your current church, believe
me....

### Act 6: Induction

**Alice**: It is impossible to know whether the sun will come up
tomorrow.

**Bob**: Boy, you're all business today. Okay, sure, something totally
unexpected could happen to prevent the sun from coming up. So what?

**Alice**: Great, let's ratchet this up: it's not even *likely* that the
sun will come up tomorrow.

**Bob**: No, you misunderstand quantum mechanics. Yes, there's a
probability distribution, but it is still *overwhelmingly likely*
that...

**Alice**: Who said anything about QM? Think bigger! How do you justify
your assumption that the laws of physics that hold today will hold
tomorrow?

**Bob**: Easy: induction. In other words, this pattern has been
repeating for a long time, so it's a good bet that it will continue to.

**Alice**: And what justifies *induction?*

**Bob**: Well, induction has worked in the past, so it will...
continue... hm.

**Alice**: Good, you are beginning to see! If induction can only be
justified by induction, then it has no justification at all. Therefore
your belief that the laws of physics will hold in five seconds has *no
justification at all*. It is meaningless to call it "likely."

**Bob**: That can't be right. Surely someone has found a flaw in this
argument...

**Alice**: As a matter of fact not!

  philosophers that they have done so).

**Alice**: We *really don't like* that the past may not exist, despite
having no valid reason to dispute it. We *really don't like* the
possibility that we are the sole observers of our world, despite it
being impossible to disprove solipsism (and some tantalizing hints from
physics). We *really don't like* the possibility that the laws of
physics will stop working in one minute, despite having no reason to
think otherwise.

Are you beginning to sense a pattern?

**Bob**: I really don't like where this is going. You're suggesting that
"what there is in place of laws" is my extremely strong affinity for
my worldview? As though one of the layers of mind that I haven't yet
penetrated in my meditation practice is what's ultimately responsible
for everything I call "reality"?

**Alice**: Indeed. You even called your worldview "self-healing," as in
*it* heals *itself*. You cannot yet admit that *you* are patching it
back up, because then you would also see that you could *stop* doing
that. That would in turn allow you to actually *test* my "crazy idea"
instead of throwing weak circular arguments at it. But of course you
don't want to do this, because part of you already knows what the
result will be. That is source of your discomfort.

**Bob**: But if I already know how it will turn out, and that makes
me uncomfortable, then the Truth -- whatever it is -- must be something
truly horrific. From what you've told me so far, it sounds like I'm
trapped all alone inside an endless dream.

**Alice**: No, the truth is far stranger, and infinitely more
beautiful, than your fearful distortions of it.

Tell me, why does the word "right" mean both "correct" and "good?" And
why does "wrong" mean both "incorrect" and "bad?"

**Bob**: Hm, I've never thought about that. I guess some part of us
feels that it's *correct* to be *good*?

**Alice**: Okay. Have you ever felt that it was correct to be malicious?

**Bob**: I've certainly done malicious things while *convincing* myself
they were right....

**Alice**: Yes, but if you really stop and introspect, don't you always
know that you should "do the right thing?"

**Bob**: You're talking about my conscience. Yes, it seems to be always
on the side of "good" -- even if I don't always know what the right
thing *is*. This is probably an evolutionary mechanism.

**Alice**: It actually comes from beyond your dream, but because it is a
Truth, it must appear *in* your dream in some form. The form you
currently allow it to take is conscience, brain mechanisms, and
evolution. Some people choose to view it as God or Buddha.

But any way you look at it, reflecting on its fundamental importance is
absolutely essential to transcending illusion. You have understood one
half with your head. Now you must grok the other with your heart.

[Act 7](act-7.html)

<!--

You may blame it all on "physics" or on "God," but one way or another,
your fundamental delusion is that you are the victim of something much
greater than yourself. It doesn't matter how much you *like* your prison;
you are still imprisoned. This is the root of all suffering.

It is what the Buddha called "samsara." You have been subjecting
yourself to it for countless eons, and you can get off the ride
whenever you wish.
