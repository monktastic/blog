### Act 6: Emptiness

**Alice**: Earlier you said that your worldview *briefly* crumbles.
Why only briefly?

**Bob**: Psychological pressure forces the original beliefs to return
very rapidly. It's as though my worldview has a powerful self-healing
mechanism.

**Alice**: This is an important insight! This mechanism is *precisely*
what prevents your worldview from being suspended for long enough to
adopt a perspective that would provide the evidence you seek.

**Bob**: Or for long enough to go crazy and *believe* that there is
good evidence.

**Alice**: You only think that your current view is rational and sane
because you haven't looked very carefully. This is why the insight about
time is so incisive. The more logic you apply to it, the more clearly
the lie of rationality is revealed.

**Bob**: But if I stopped believing in time, my life would fall apart.

**Alice**: How do you know? The closest you've come is *pretending*
that it doesn't exist. Obviously that would be a bad life choice. Not
only that, but it is possible to have a *functional* belief in time
without taking it *literally.*

**Bob**: So what happens if I actually stop?

**Alice**: There's still too big of a gap from where you are to describe
it to you. Let's start with something easier than time, though it's
ultimately very related.

Suppose I told you that by deeply forgiving someone -- more deeply than
you've had the courage to do so far -- that it might undo whatever pain
it is inside of them that caused them to behave the way they had?

**Bob**: That doesn't sound very mystical. Obviously our emotions affect
other people.

**Alice**: Good. Can you see that before, during, and after your usual 
attempts at forgiveness, you are holding tightly to this worldview? 
Specifically, one in which you are two separate people; that she is 
someone who has done wrong; that any possible healing must be done via
your sanctioned mechanisms?

**Bob**: Sure, but all of that stuff is *true*.

**Alice**: See what happens if you deeply release all of that. For example,
you might adopt the half-way realization that you never really see
another person; you only see your mental image of them. Next, perhaps
you can completely release the idea that they've done *wrong*. For
example, you might reflect on the possibility that they were doing their
best at the time. And release any sense of limitation on how much
healing is possible for both of you. Feel love so overwhelming that
you are brought to tears.

**Bob**: That sounds beautiful. But why would it prove anything?

**Alice**: You may not get "proof" in one fell swoop. Instead, something
in your life may heal in such a way that you're unsure of whether it fits
entirely within your worldview. That point is another red pill / blue pill
moment. You don't have to go Full Woo and believe in the Magic of Love.
But you might be inspired to loosen your stranglehold on the world.

If you do, maybe you find more opportunities for healing, and perhaps
they push your boundaries a little more each time....

**Bob**: I don't understand. Push my boundaries on *what?* What will
the evidence *look like?*

**Alice**: On how the world "can" and "cannot" work. On your ability
to see that your perspective of the world *is* the
world. That what you do in your mind, you do in the world. The evidence
will look like a world that heals in a way that reflects your own
healing.
