### Act 2: Mind control

**Alice**: On the other hand, might it just be that your current
perspective doesn't allow for such possibilities, and *that* explains
why you don't see it happening?

**Bob**: Hmm. That *is* internally consistent. On the other hand, let me
test it out. "I hereby believe that reality can be shifted at will. I
also believe that I have a million dollars in the bank."

*Bob pulls out his phone to demonstrate his woeful bank balance.*

**Alice**: You really ought to contribute to a 401(k), Bob. But why do
you think that demonstrates anything? Do you really have complete
command over your mind?

**Bob**: If you'll recall, I do have a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from
Harvard. So yeah, I'd say I have a pretty good command.

**Alice**: I don't mean that kind of command. I mean for example, when
you're reading a book, do you ever suddenly discover that your eyes
have been scanning the page while your mind has been wandering?

**Bob**: Of course. Doesn't that happen to everyone?

**Alice**: Everyone except moderately trained meditators, yes. In that
zoned-out phase, are you conscious or unconscious of your thoughts?

**Bob**: Hmm... I'd say it's a hybrid. On one hand, I don't *know* that
I'm wandering, so kind of unconscious. On the other hand, if you ask me
what I'm thinking about, I can tell you, so kind of conscious.

**Alice**: Exactly. Have you noticed that virtually your entire day is
spent in this semi-conscious haze?

**Bob**: That's absurd. I would definitely notice that.

**Alice**: Just like you definitely notice yourself reading mindlessly?
In your daily life you may become present for a fraction of a second
every few minutes, but then your mind goes right back to zombie mode,
and back-fills a just-so story making you *believe* that you've been
present.

**Bob**: How can I test this out for myself?

**Alice**: Sit in a quiet place and pay attention to your breath. Every
time you notice your mind wandering, gently release the thoughts and
return to the breath.

**Bob**: You're just trying to get me to meditate!

**Alice**: Guilty as charged!

**Bob**: Fine, I'll take you up on this challenge.

*Bob ships off to a monastery to meditate for three months.*
