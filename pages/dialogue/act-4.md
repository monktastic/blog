### Act 4: Radical skepticism

**Bob**: I think I know how you'll respond to most of these, but I'll
play along. This picture we took yesterday is evidence of the past.

**Alice**: What if reality actually just sprang into being *now*, fully
formed, with that picture (and your memory) as convincing artifacts?

**Bob**: This sounds like the young earth creationist Omphalos
Hypothesis, which says that God planted dinosaur bones as a test of
our faith. But I admit, there's no way to disprove it by collecting
evidence.

**Alice**: Is there any reason to think it's *unlikely?*

**Bob**: Of course. Universes don't just spring into being from nothing.
That would violate the laws of physics.

**Alice**: Doesn't that presuppose that everything you know is true?
When did you get your physics degree if reality popped into being *now*?

**Bob**: Right, it's circular. On the other hand, Occam's Razor suggests
that the simplest possibility is usually correct. Since time is the
simplest explanation, we should choose it.

**Alice**: How do you justify Occam's Razor?

**Bob**: Well it has a long history of... oh, I see. Well, I can still
use it as a guiding principle. Simpler theories are more beautiful.

**Alice**: But then aren't you just stating a *preference*, and not a
logical justification?

**Bob**: It's more than just *preference!* We should believe in time
because that belief *works.*

**Alice**: And how do you *know* that it works?

**Bob**: It's been working since time sprang into being a minute ago,
hasn't it?

**Alice**: A minute ago? But reality just sprang into being... *now*.

**Bob**: I'm feeling rather annoyed, but everything you say is logically
unimpeachable. I understand now that there's no *reason* to believe in
time, but I find that I cannot help myself.

**Alice**: What do you think accounts for this difficulty?

**Bob**: Well if time is real, then it would be evolutionarily
advantageous to believe in it, and so my reptilian brain is hard-wired
that way. Hmm, that's also circular. I think I'm beginning to see a
pattern.

**Alice**: Wonderful. You are now at a decision point. On one hand, you
can sweep this all under the rug: *"there's probably a perfectly good
explanation for all this."* On the other, you could choose to penetrate
the fiendishly clever trap in which the mind has ensnared itself. And it
doesn't even require a multi-month retreat. If you're sincere, you can
get a tiny glimpse by staring squarely into the face of what you have
begun to unearth: *It is not "unlikely" that the past is an illusion.*

**Bob**: Seriously? Isn't this red pill / blue pill analogy a little
stereotypical?

**Alice**: Whatever. I've always wanted to use it. Anyway, take this
understanding deep into your heart until you feel the ground being
pulled out from under your feet. This is how you will know you are
ready to continue. If you still feel nothing more than a "so what?",
perhaps now is not the time to be woken up.

### Interlude

**Bob**: Okay, I may have gotten a taste of the vertiginous feeling
you described. But it also brought with it something... refreshing.

**Alice**: Indeed. Your life feels mundane precisely because of your
death grip on a belief that has no basis: that there's nothing
particularly special about *this* moment, since you had one just like
it a moment ago, and a moment before that, etc. Genuine appreciation
is impossible while you cling to time.

**Bob**: Is this just another trick to get me to be mindful?

**Alice**: No. If anything, mindfulness is a trick to get you to go beyond it.

**Bob**: Hmm, I'll have to chew on that....

### Quotes

Mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell:

> "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past."

He ultimately loses courage:

> “Skepticism, while **logically impeccable**, is **psychologically
impossible**, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any
philosophy which pretends to accept it.”

David Hume (whose brilliant Problem of Induction similarly
deconstructs the future):

> "Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument which
I have been to such pains to inculcate, whether I be really one of those
skeptics who hold that everything is uncertain, I should reply that
neither I nor any other person was ever sincerely and constantly of
that opinion. I dine, I play backgammon, I converse and am merry with
my friends and when after three or four hours of amusement I would return
to these speculations, they appear so cold and strange and ridiculous
that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any further. Thus the
skeptic still continues to reason and believe, though he asserts he
**cannot defend his reason by reason.**"

Modern physicist Sean Carroll, discussing a similar point:

> “There is **no way** to distinguish between the scenarios by
collecting new data.
>
> What we’re left with is our choice of prior credences. We’re allowed
to pick priors however we want—and every possibility should get some
nonzero number. But it’s okay to set our prior credence in radically
skeptical scenarios at very low values, and attach higher prior credence
to the straightforwardly realistic possibilities.
>
> Radical skepticism is less useful to us; it gives us no way to go
through life. All of our purported knowledge, and all of our goals and
aspirations, might very well be tricks being played on us. But what
then? We cannot actually act on such a belief, since any act we might
think is reasonable would have been suggested to us by that annoying
demon. Whereas, if we take the world roughly at face value, we have a
way of moving forward. There are things we want to do, questions we
want to answer, and strategies for making them happen. **We have every
right to give high credence to views of the world that are productive
and fruitful, in preference to those that would leave us paralyzed
with ennui.**”

In other words, since reason and evidence cannot help, we should pick
the view that works best. Of course, as we saw, if time itself is
suspect, then we cannot even say that our view is "productive."
