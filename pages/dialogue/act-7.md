to believe. I tend to think that the workings of the conscious brain
will be elucidated to a large extent. Biologists and perhaps physicists
will understand much better how the brain works. But why something that
we call consciousness goes with those workings, I think that will remain
mysterious. I have a much easier time imagining how we understand the
Big Bang than I have imagining how we can understand consciousness...*

with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics,
and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go
away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.*

### Act 7: Consciousness

**Bob**: So far you've only given me *negative* evidence: evidence that I
might be wrong. Surely there's also positive evidence for your claims?

**Alice**: I can, but I can't promise you'll recognize it as evidence.
If you don't, that's okay. Don't push it. These defense mechanisms exist
within you for a reason.

**Bob**: Noted. Okay, hit me.

**Alice**: I'll start with a small one. Scientists in your reality claim that
consciousness is either physical -- the result of brain processes --
or else nonexistent.

**Alice**: But it is easy to see why both of these are wrong, if you just bother
to look. First, as we saw with the "problem of other minds," there is
no way to be certain that other people are conscious, right?

**Bob**: Sure. I can *infer* it from their behavior, but that is all.

**Alice**: Let's probe deeper. Maybe a technology will be invented that lets
you experience someone else's consciousness?

**Bob**: Lets *me* experience. That's still *my* consciousness, supposedly
experiencing theirs. Besides that, I can't ever know if this world is
a simulation, in which case the "other person" and the "technology"
are illusions, too. So it is not a technological limitation, but a
theoretical one. I cannot, in principle, be sure of another's
consciousness.

**Alice**: Can you be sure of your own?

**Bob**: Hmm. No, I could be a simulation, too.

**Alice**: Let me try another way. Doesn't it seem to you like *something is
happening?* Sights, sounds, smells, thoughts, emotions, etc.?

**Bob**: Yes, but those could all be illusions, too.

**Alice**: I'm not asking what they *are.* I'm asking: doesn't it damn sure
*seem like something is happening?*

**Bob**: I guess, yes.

**Alice**: Guessing isn't good enough.

**Bob**: Well maybe "seeming" is an illusion, too....

**Alice**: Drop the philosophy for now. Don't try to dissect my words.
Just look, and answer very simply: doesn't it seem like something is
happening?

**Bob**: Yes. Definitely.

**Alice**: Good. Like, totally sure, right?

**Bob**: [*Pauses, closes eyes, and listens...*] Yes, I'm with you.

**Alice**: Awesome.

Forget Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" nonsense. This "sheer fact
of seeming" is the one thing it is meaningless to doubt. Now, if you
don't actually *do* the exercise of looking, and instead
let your *intellect* run off with the question, it will come up with
all sorts of clever reasons to doubt it. That's a great way to win an
argument or get a philosophy Ph.D., but useless for waking up.

Despite this being literally the only thing to see, somehow we continually
overlook it. When you *do* look, you immediately experience a brief
return to a glorious place you never left. This is a small form of
awakening.

**Bob**: I admit it's lovely. But what does this prove?

**Alice**: As you've probably guessed, this "sheer fact of seeming" is a
synonym for "consciousness." You now have the ability to demonstrate
for yourself that it is "real" in a meaningful sense.

**Bob**: Okay, but why can't it be physical?

**Alice**: If something is physical, shouldn't physical instruments be able to
detect it?

**Bob**: Yes. In fact there's already a reasonably good
[consciousness meter](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-make-a-consciousness-meter/).

**Alice**: I thought you said we can't be sure of anyone else's consciousness.

**Bob**: Well we can be *reasonably* sure.

**Alice**: If someone else held that meter up to *you,* why could they
only be *reasonably sure* of something that you're *flawlessly sure* of?

**Bob**: Hmm I think I catch the drift. If something is physical, it
ought to be equally verifiable by anyone, in principle, given the right
tools.

So maybe my certainty in my own consciousness is misplaced....

**Alice**: I think I spy an intellect trying to stuff everything into
its clown-car worldview.

Let go and just look again.

**Bob**: Holy shit, wonder of wonders. *That*.

**Alice**: Yeah, *that*.

**Bob**: I think I'm going to go meditate.
