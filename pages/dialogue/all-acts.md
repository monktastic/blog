  Milarepa came to welcome him on a barren plateau. After they had exchanged

  the flat open plain. Milarepa spotted a yak horn on the ground and quickly
  took refuge inside of it -- without the horn becoming larger or Milarepa
  becoming smaller. From his dry shelter, Milarepa sang a song letting

### Act 1: The Fairground

Alice and Bob are walking through an art fair. They stop to appreciate
the brilliance of an art piece. Is it two giraffes or an elephant?

style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

**Alice**: It depends on which way you look at it.

**Bob**: Right. In some sense it is both, and in another sense, neither.

**Alice**: In a way, it's similar to reality. What reality *is* depends
on how you *perceive* it.

**Bob**: Of course, there's a limit. Just as with the sculpture, you can
choose to *see* the world in different ways, but ultimately the
underlying reality restricts how you can *interact* with it.

**Alice**: Are you *sure* of that?

**Bob**: *[Spits out coffee]* What? Explain yourself.

**Alice**: Well, what if the sculpture analogy ultimately breaks down?
What if your perspective on reality *is* reality? What if there were a
way to "rotate" reality -- or rotate yourself *through* reality, if you
prefer -- in such a way that *seeing* an elephant allowed you to
*interact* with it?

**Bob**: In other words, what if by changing our perspective on reality,
we could change reality itself? In an *objectively verifiable* way?

**Alice**: That's the general idea, yes.

**Bob**: Then all of science would be disproved, and obviously that
hasn't happened, so... [QED, bitches](https://xkcd.com/622/)!

**Alice**: Haha, you got me, old chap!

*Bob pulls out a pipe to celebrate.*

---

[Act 2](act-2.html)

### Act 2: Mind control

**Alice**: On the other hand, might it just be that your current
perspective doesn't allow for such possibilities, and *that* explains
why they aren't happening in your world?

**Bob**: Hmm. That *is* internally consistent. On the other hand, let me
test it out. "I hereby believe that reality can be shifted at will. I
also believe that I have a million dollars in the bank."

*Bob pulls out his phone to demonstrate his woeful bank balance.*

**Alice**: You really ought to contribute to a 401(k), Bob. But why do
you think that demonstrates anything? Do you really have complete
command over your mind?

**Bob**: If you'll recall, I do have a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from
Harvard. So yeah, I'd say I have a pretty good command.

**Alice**: I don't mean that kind of command. I mean for example, when
you're reading a book, do you ever suddenly discover that your eyes
have been scanning the page while your mind has been wandering?

**Bob**: Of course. Doesn't that happen to everyone?

**Alice**: Everyone except moderately trained meditators, yes. In that
zoned-out phase, are you conscious or unconscious of your thoughts?

**Bob**: Hmm... I'd say it's a hybrid. On one hand, I don't *know* that
I'm wandering, so kind of unconscious. On the other hand, if you ask me
what I'm thinking about, I can tell you, so kind of conscious.

**Alice**: Exactly. Have you noticed that virtually your entire day is
spent in this semi-conscious haze?

**Bob**: That's absurd. I would definitely notice that.

**Alice**: Just like you definitely notice yourself reading mindlessly?
In your daily life you may become present for a fraction of a second
every few minutes, but then your mind goes right back to zombie mode,
and back-fills a just-so story making you *believe* that you've been
present.

**Bob**: How can I test this out for myself?

**Alice**: Sit in a quiet place and pay attention to your breath. Every
time you notice your mind wandering, gently release the thoughts and
return to the breath.

**Bob**: You're just trying to get me to meditate!

**Alice**: Guilty as charged!

**Bob**: Fine, I'll take you up on this challenge.

*Bob ships off to a monastery to meditate for three months.*

---

[Act 3](act-3.html)
### Act 3: Layers of mind

**Bob**: Wow, that was remarkable.

**Alice**: What did you learn?

**Bob**: At first, it seemed easy to pay attention to the breath. Then, after
some days of nonstop practice, I noticed that my attention seemed to
be getting *worse*. I was being interrupted by thoughts all the time!

**Alice**: Why would your attention become worse by meditating?

**Bob**: Turns out it didn't. I merely began *noticing* how busy my mind had
always been. Once that layer of nonstop internal monologue calmed down
after some weeks, I discovered there were more layers beneath!

**Alice**: Such as?

**Bob**: Subtle thoughts about how I was feeling. I understand so much more
about myself -- about my mood and personality, for example -- than I
could ever have hoped to before. And now that I see that we're *all*
neurotic in this way, it's *so much easier* to be kind.

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle*
> -- Philo of Alexandria

**Alice**: That sounds wonderful! So, are you done? Have you attained
enlightenment?

**Bob**: I don't know. I am able to sit in a very peaceful state, with my
mind lucid and unmoving. Does that count?

**Alice**: So it still feels like you are an individual located in space and
time doing something called "meditation."

**Bob**: Of course, why wouldn't it?

**Alice**: You are far from done. You have not even penetrated the layer of
mind that gives rise to the illusion of physical reality.

**Bob**: I don't like where you are going with this. What do you mean
"the illusion of?"

**Alice**: Let me ask you: *why* do you believe in time?

*Bob becomes pensive.*

---

[Act 4](act-4.html)### Act 4: Radical skepticism

**Bob**: I think I know how you'll respond to most of these, but I'll
play along. This picture we took yesterday is evidence of the past.

**Alice**: What if reality actually just sprang into being *now*, fully
formed, with that picture (and your memory) as convincing artifacts?

**Bob**: This sounds like the young earth creationist Omphalos
Hypothesis, which says that God planted dinosaur bones as a test of
our faith. But I admit, there's no way to disprove it by collecting
evidence.

**Alice**: Is there any reason to think it's *unlikely?*

**Bob**: Of course. Universes don't just spring into being from nothing.
That would violate the laws of physics.

**Alice**: Doesn't that presuppose that everything you know is true?
When did you get your physics degree if reality popped into being *now*?

**Bob**: Right, it's circular. On the other hand, Occam's Razor suggests
that the simplest possibility is usually correct. Since time is the
simplest explanation, we should choose it.

**Alice**: How do you justify Occam's Razor?

**Bob**: Well it has a long history of... oh, I see. Well, I can still
use it as a guiding principle. Simpler theories are more beautiful.

**Alice**: But then aren't you just stating a *preference*, and not a
logical justification?

**Bob**: It's more than just *preference!* We should believe in time
because that belief *works.*

**Alice**: And how do you *know* that it works?

**Bob**: It's been working since time sprang into being a minute ago,
hasn't it?

**Alice**: A minute ago? But reality just sprang into being... *now*.

**Bob**: I'm feeling rather annoyed, but everything you say is logically
unimpeachable. I understand now that there's no *reason* to believe in
time, but I find that I cannot help myself.

**Alice**: What do you think accounts for this difficulty?

**Bob**: Well if time is real, then it would be evolutionarily
advantageous to believe in it, and so my reptilian brain is hard-wired
that way. Hmm, that's also circular. I think I'm beginning to see a
pattern.

**Alice**: Wonderful. You are now at a decision point. On one hand, you
can sweep this all under the rug: *"there's probably a perfectly good
explanation for all this."* On the other, you could choose to penetrate
the fiendishly clever trap in which the mind has ensnared itself. And it
doesn't even require a multi-month retreat. If you're sincere, you can
get a tiny glimpse by staring squarely into the face of what you have
begun to unearth: *It is not "unlikely" that the past is an illusion.*

**Bob**: Seriously? Isn't this red pill / blue pill analogy a little
stereotypical?

**Alice**: Whatever. I've always wanted to use it. Anyway, take this
understanding deep into your heart until you feel the ground being
pulled out from under your feet. This is how you will know you are
ready to continue. If you still feel nothing more than a "so what?",
perhaps now is not the time to be woken up.

### Interlude

**Bob**: Okay, I may have gotten a taste of the vertiginous feeling
you described. But it also brought with it something... refreshing.

**Alice**: Indeed. Your life feels mundane precisely because of your
death grip on a belief that has no basis: that there's nothing
particularly special about *this* moment, since you had one just like
it a moment ago, and a moment before that, etc. Genuine appreciation
is impossible while you cling to time.

**Bob**: Is this just another trick to get me to be mindful?

**Alice**: No. If anything, mindfulness is a trick to get you to go beyond it.

**Bob**: Hmm, I'll have to chew on that....

### Quotes

Mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell:

> "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past."

He ultimately loses courage:

> “Skepticism, while **logically impeccable**, is **psychologically
impossible**, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any
philosophy which pretends to accept it.”

David Hume (whose brilliant Problem of Induction similarly
deconstructs the future):

> "Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument which
I have been to such pains to inculcate, whether I be really one of those
skeptics who hold that everything is uncertain, I should reply that
neither I nor any other person was ever sincerely and constantly of
that opinion. I dine, I play backgammon, I converse and am merry with
my friends and when after three or four hours of amusement I would return
to these speculations, they appear so cold and strange and ridiculous
that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any further. Thus the
skeptic still continues to reason and believe, though he asserts he
**cannot defend his reason by reason.**"

Modern physicist Sean Carroll, discussing a similar point:

> “There is **no way** to distinguish between the scenarios by
collecting new data.
>
> What we’re left with is our choice of prior credences. We’re allowed
to pick priors however we want—and every possibility should get some
nonzero number. But it’s okay to set our prior credence in radically
skeptical scenarios at very low values, and attach higher prior credence
to the straightforwardly realistic possibilities.
>
> Radical skepticism is less useful to us; it gives us no way to go
through life. All of our purported knowledge, and all of our goals and
aspirations, might very well be tricks being played on us. But what
then? We cannot actually act on such a belief, since any act we might
think is reasonable would have been suggested to us by that annoying
demon. Whereas, if we take the world roughly at face value, we have a
way of moving forward. There are things we want to do, questions we
want to answer, and strategies for making them happen. **We have every
right to give high credence to views of the world that are productive
and fruitful, in preference to those that would leave us paralyzed
with ennui.**”

In other words, since reason and evidence cannot help, we should pick
the view that works best. Of course, as we saw, if time itself is
suspect, then we cannot even say that our view is "productive."

### Act 5: Quantum woo

**Bob**: The experiment with time reminded me of something that always
bothered me about quantum physics.

**Alice**: Oh, no. Not this quantum woo-woo stuff!

**Bob**: No! You know I'm not that type. Despite over a hundred years of
arguing, the community doesn't agree on a formulation or interpretation.
I doubt we'll settle it here. But something occurred to me about *why*
it's so hard to agree. If you follow only orthodox, well-established
rules, you end up in a funny place.

> *I suspect that a substantial majority of physicists who use quantum
  mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright
  hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.*
>
> &nbsp;
>
> -- Caltech physicist Sean Carroll

**Alice**: Are you including
[wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)
as one of those rules?

**Bob**: Oh, no. The idea of a "collapse" is far from accepted. You can
think of it as one of many ways we've tried to avoid the absurd
conclusion I'm about to show you.

As you well know, under the usual unitary evolution rules,
Schrodinger's Cat is in a *superposition* before you see it. You cannot
say "the cat is *either* dead or alive"; both possibilities still
exist.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/215aSTX.jpg" width="350" align="middle"
style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

**Alice**: How do we *know* they both exist? Why can't we say it's just
one or the other? I know with a single particle, we can do something
called an interference experiment[1]. I thought that was impossible for
cat-sized objects.

**Bob**: The relatively recent theory of *decoherence* explains why it
is very, very hard *in practice* for large objects, but it in no way
denies that they are there *in principle*. This is a common
misconception[2]. Though we are a far cry from a cat, we *have*
done such experiments on macroscopic objects[3], and see no fundamental
limits yet.

Now, what about *after* you encounter the cat? Tell me, if you
encountered a decomposing cat, would you feel comfortable saying that
it is, in fact, dead?

**Alice**: I don't know if "comfortable" is the right word, but of
course I would. Who wouldn't?

**Bob**: Clearly you haven't met many philosophers. But tell me, what
changed in the moment you encountered the cat? What enables you to
say it has a well-defined fate now, when you couldn't before?

**Alice**: Perhaps I just learned the real answer in that moment?

**Bob**: Come on, you're smarter than that. We *just* said that *there
was no answer yet.*

**Alice**: Maybe there was an answer! What if my friend saw it first?
She would know the real answer.

**Bob**: Yes, Eugene Wigner tried doing this, too. It is
weird to think of a live human as being in a superposition, so maybe
conscious creatures collapse the wave function[4]. Let's not devolve
into such woo here. If the cat is dead, your friend sees that; if it is
alive, she sees that; both possibilities are still in superposition.

**Alice**: Ah, well if my friend can "split" then so can I. How about
this: the universe splits in two, with one "copy" of me seeing one
result, and the other "copy" seeing the other?

**Bob**: Yes, that's called the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation)
(MWI), but it doesn't solve anything[5]. For any "copy of you" --
henceforth, just "you" -- the cat's fate is still not decided until
*you* encounter it, directly or indirectly. It is as though the *truth*
comes into being simultaneously with your *knowledge* of it. You,
personally, and nobody else.

**Alice**: *[Smirking subtly]* That's absurd!

**Bob**: I have a feeling you know more than you're letting on, Alice.
But it gets worse: even if the cat *has been dead* for some time, *that*
wasn't true a moment ago. The *history* of the cat's fate comes into
being in that moment. But then the past isn't what I think it is. It's
more like a back-story concocted to explain the present.

**Alice**: And what exactly do you mean by "you" and "encounter" or
"knowledge" here?

**Bob**: Yes, that is tricky. If my *toe* encounters it first, then
in the microseconds it takes for the signal to propagate to "me",
the cat's fate *still* hasn't been settled. The toe is as external to
me as my friend is. So where, precisely, is this "me" that it has to
reach?

"Knowledge" is hard, too. Suppose the information only reaches me
very weakly, such as through a very faint reflection. If I only have
partial knowledge of the result, then in some sense the cat's fate is
only *partly* decided[6]. It is as though the more knowledgeable I am
of the result, the more real it is.

But then what happens if I *forget* the result so thoroughly that
my brain contains no trace of it[7]? Is the cat's fate "reset"? Ah,
this is all a bit too much!

**Alice**: We will come back to this "forgetting" thing later. But what
does this all tell you?

**Bob**: Well, seen from this perspective, many attempts to modify QM
stem from the need to avoid this strange conclusion. That doesn't mean
that this conclusion is *right*, of course, but *it* is a reasonably
straightforward interpretation of the available facts.

Either way, it seems to be doing something useful for me. When I
confront it very squarely -- like you made me do for the "time as an
illusion" idea -- I end up in the same strange space as before.
My worldview briefly crumbles.

[2] [The decoherence myth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

[4] See the [Wigner - von Neumann interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretation)
aka "consciousness causes collapse."

However, there's good reason to believe that he championed this idea
to avoid an even uglier possibility:

> This takes place whenever the result of an observation enters the
  consciousness of the observer - or, to be even more painfully precise,
  my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people
  being only subjects of my observations.

...

> However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
  extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
  people, in their hearts, will go along with it.

[5] One argument might be that the worlds split before you see it,
and thus there *is* an answer already. But we do not make predictions
based on "worlds"; the state vector is sufficient. And if you are *not*
entangled with it, then you are still capable of demonstrating the
superposition, no matter the interpretation regarding "worlds."

[6]
In layman's terms: a measuring device only destroys your ability to
detect interference insofar as the device can reliably tell apart the
two cases. If you were asleep when you "saw" the cat, then your brain
doesn't have reliable information, and you can treat it almost the same
as if you had never encountered it. This reliability is a spectrum.

More technically: a state `|0>|A> + |1>|B>` is decoherent (w.r.t the
first qubit) only insofar as `|A>` and `|B>` have small inner product.
Therefore if my brain states are largely indistinguishable in the two
cases, then the partial trace of the system w.r.t my brain is roughly
the same as before my brain became entangled with it, and it will still
exhibit (slightly weaker) interference.

The general idea is well established. See, e.g.
[here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/35049/118804).

[7] In other words, what if we could do a
[quantum eraser experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment)
with your brain? Again, we've only done it thus far for very small
systems, but we don't know of a theoretical limitation.

### Interlude

**Alice**: Earlier you said that your worldview *briefly* crumbles when
you confront certain facts. Why only briefly?

**Bob**: Psychological pressure forces the original beliefs to return
very rapidly. It's as though my worldview has a powerful self-healing
mechanism.

**Alice**: This is an important insight! This mechanism is *precisely*
what prevents your worldview from being suspended for long enough to
adopt the perspective that would provide the evidence you seek.

**Bob**: So what you're telling me is that I have to go crazy *first*,
and then I'll start seeing crazy things. Awesome. What are the monthly
dues for your church again?

**Alice**: Oh it's much less costly than your current church, believe
me....

### Act 6: Induction

**Alice**: It is impossible to know whether the sun will come up
tomorrow.

**Bob**: Boy, you're all business today. Okay, sure, something totally
unexpected could happen to prevent the sun from coming up. So what?

**Alice**: Great, let's ratchet this up: it's not even *likely* that the
sun will come up tomorrow.

**Bob**: No, you misunderstand quantum mechanics. Yes, there's a
probability distribution, but it is still *overwhelmingly likely*
that...

**Alice**: Who said anything about QM? Think bigger! How do you justify
your assumption that the laws of physics that hold today will hold
tomorrow?

**Bob**: Easy: induction. In other words, this pattern has been
repeating for a long time, so it's a good bet that it will continue to.

**Alice**: And what justifies *induction?*

**Bob**: Well, induction has worked in the past, so it will...
continue... hm.

**Alice**: Good, you are beginning to see! If induction can only be
justified by induction, then it has no justification at all. Therefore
your belief that the laws of physics will hold in five seconds has *no
justification at all*. It is meaningless to call it "likely."

**Bob**: That can't be right. Surely someone has found a flaw in this
argument...

**Alice**: As a matter of fact not!

> Hume’s argument continues to perplex both philosophers and scientists.

> &nbsp;
>
> [David Hume's Problem of Induction](http://stephenlaw.blogspot.com/2012/10/problem-of-induction-explained-simply.html)

**Alice**: We *really don't like* that the past may not exist, despite
having no valid reason to dispute it. We *really don't like* the
possibility that we are the sole observers of our world, despite it
being impossible to disprove solipsism (and some tantalizing hints from
physics). We *really don't like* the possibility that the laws of
physics will stop working in one minute, despite having no reason to
think otherwise.

Are you beginning to sense a pattern?

**Bob**: I really don't like where this is going. You're suggesting that
"what there is in place of laws" is my extremely strong affinity for
my worldview? As though one of the layers of mind that I haven't yet
penetrated in my meditation practice is what's ultimately responsible
for everything I call "reality"?

**Alice**: Indeed. You even called your worldview "self-healing," as in
*it* heals *itself*. You cannot yet admit that *you* are patching it
back up, because then you would also see that you could **stop doing
that**. That would in turn allow you to actually *test* my "crazy idea"
instead of throwing weak circular arguments at it. But of course you
don't want to do this, because part of you already knows what the
result will be. That is the discomfort you feel.

**Bob**: But if I already know how it will turn out, and that makes
me uncomfortable, then the Truth -- whatever it is -- must be something
truly horrific. From what you've told me so far, it sounds like I'm
trapped all alone inside an endless dream.

**Alice**: No, the truth is far stranger, and infinitely more
beautiful, than your fearful distortions of it.

Tell me, why does the word "right" mean both "correct" and "good?" And
why does "wrong" mean both "incorrect" and "bad"?

**Bob**: Hm, I've never thought about that. Perhaps some part of us
feels that it's *correct* to be *good*?

**Alice**: Okay. Have you ever felt that it was correct to be malicious?

**Bob**: I've certainly done malicious things while *convincing* myself
they were right....

**Alice**: Yes, but if you really stop and introspect, don't you always
know that you should "do the right thing?"

**Bob**: You're talking about my conscience. Yes, it seems to be always on
the side of "good" -- even if I don't yet know what the right thing is.
This is probably an evolutionary mechanism.

**Alice**: It actually comes from beyond your dream, but because it is a
Truth, it must appear *in* your dream in some form. The form you
currently allow it to take is conscience, brain mechanisms, and
evolution. Some people choose to view it as God or Buddha.

But any way you look at it, reflecting on its fundamental importance is
absolutely essential to transcending illusion. You have understood one
half with your head. Now you must grok the other with your heart.

mysterious. I have a much easier time imagining how we understand the
Big Bang than I have imagining how we can understand consciousness...*

away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.*

### Act 7: Consciousness

**Bob**: So far you've only given me *negative* evidence: evidence that I
might be wrong. Surely there's also positive evidence for your claims?

**Alice**: I can, but I can't promise you'll recognize it as evidence.
If you don't, that's okay. Don't push it. These defense mechanisms exist
within you for a reason.

**Bob**: Noted. Okay, hit me.

**Alice**: I'll start with a small one. Scientists in your reality claim that
consciousness is either physical -- the result of brain processes --
or else nonexistent.

**Alice**: But it is easy to see why both of these are wrong, if you just bother
to look. First, as we saw with the "problem of other minds," there is
no way to be certain that other people are conscious, right?

**Bob**: Sure. I can *infer* it from their behavior, but that is all.

**Alice**: Let's probe deeper. Maybe a technology will be invented that lets
you experience someone else's consciousness?

**Bob**: Lets *me* experience. That's still *my* consciousness, supposedly
experiencing theirs. Besides that, I can't ever know if this world is
a simulation, in which case the "other person" and the "technology"
are illusions, too. So it is not a technological limitation, but a
theoretical one. I cannot, in principle, be sure of another's
consciousness.

**Alice**: Can you be sure of your own?

**Bob**: Hmm. No, I could be a simulation, too.

**Alice**: Let me try another way. Doesn't it seem to you like *something is
happening?* Sights, sounds, smells, thoughts, emotions, etc.?

**Bob**: Yes, but those could all be illusions, too.

**Alice**: I'm not asking what they *are.* I'm asking: doesn't it damn sure
*seem like something is happening?*

**Bob**: I guess, yes.

**Alice**: Guessing isn't good enough.

**Bob**: Well maybe "seeming" is an illusion, too....

**Alice**: Drop the philosophy for now. Don't try to dissect my words.
Just look, and answer very simply: doesn't it seem like something is
happening?

**Bob**: *Ah*. Wow. Yes. Definitely.

**Alice**: Good.

Forget Decartes' "I think, therefore I am" nonsense. This "sheer fact
of seeming" is the one thing it is meaningless
to doubt. Now, if you don't actually *do* the exercise of looking, and instead
let your *intellect* run off with the question, it will come up with all sorts
of clever reasons to doubt it. That's a great way to get a philosophy
Ph.D., but useless for waking up.

Despite this being literally the only thing to see, somehow we continually
overlook it. When you *do* look, you immediately experience a brief
return to a glorious place you never left. This is a small form of
awakening.

**Bob**: I admit it's lovely. But what does this prove?

**Alice**: As you've probably guessed, this "sheer fact of seeming" is a
synonym for "consciousness." You now have the ability to demonstrate
for yourself that it is "real" in a meaningful sense.

**Bob**: Okay, but why can't it be physical?

**Alice**: If something is physical, shouldn't physical instruments be able to
detect it?

**Bob**: Yes. In fact there's already a reasonably good
[consciousness meter](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-make-a-consciousness-meter/).

**Alice**: I thought you said we can't be sure of anyone else's consciousness.

**Bob**: Well we can be *reasonably* sure.

**Alice**: If someone else held that meter up to *you,* why could they only be 
*reasonably sure* of something that you're *totally sure* of?

**Bob**: Hmm I think I catch the drift. If it's physical, it ought to be
equally verifiable by anyone, in principle, given the right tools.

So maybe my certainty in my own consciousness is misplaced....

**Alice**: I think I smell an intellect run amok, trying to stuff
everything into its clown-car worldview! "Nothing to see here!"

Let it go and look again.

**Bob**: Holy shit, wonder of wonders. *That*.

**Alice**: Yeah, *that*.

**Bob**: I think I'm going to go meditate.
