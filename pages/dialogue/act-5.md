### Act 5: Quantum woo

**Bob**: The experiment with time reminded me of something that always
bothered me about quantum physics.

**Alice**: Oh, no. Not this quantum woo-woo stuff!

**Bob**: No! You know I'm not that type. Despite over a hundred years of
arguing, the community doesn't agree on a formulation or interpretation.
I doubt we'll settle it here. But something occurred to me about *why*
it's so hard to agree. If you follow only orthodox, well-established
rules, you end up in a funny place.

> *For quantum mechanics ... all we really have to do (most
people believe) is think about it in the right way. No elaborate
experiments necessarily required (although they could help nudge us in
the right direction, no doubt about that). But if anything, that makes
the embarrassment more acute. All we have to do is wrap our brains
around the issue, and yet we’ve failed to do so.*

**Alice**: Are you including
[wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)
as one of the "orthodox rules?"

**Bob**: Oh, no. The idea of a "collapse" is far from accepted. You can
think of it as one of many shoehorned interventions we've invented to
avoid the absurd conclusion I'm about to show you.

As you well know, under the usual unitary evolution rules,
Schrodinger's Cat is in a *superposition* before you see it. You cannot
say "the cat is *either* dead or alive"; both possibilities still
exist.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/215aSTX.jpg" width="350" align="middle"
style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

**Alice**: How do we *know* they both exist? Why can't we say it's just
one or the other? I know with a single particle, we can do something
called an interference experiment[1]. I thought that was impossible for
cat-sized objects.

**Bob**: It is virtually impossible *in practice*, yes, but nothing so
far suggests that it is impossible *in theory*. This difference may
seem trivial -- and it *is* for the practicing physicist -- but it in
no way resolves the fundamental problem. Believing so is a common
misconception[2]. Though we are a far cry from a cat, we *have* done
such experiments on macroscopic objects[3], and see no fundamental
limits yet.

Now, what about *after* you encounter the cat? Tell me, if you
encountered a decomposing cat, would you feel comfortable saying that
it is, in fact, dead?

**Alice**: I don't know if "comfortable" is the right word, but of
course I would. Who wouldn't?

**Bob**: Clearly you haven't met many philosophers. But tell me, what
changed in the moment you encountered the cat? What enables you to
say it has a well-defined fate now, when you couldn't before?

**Alice**: Perhaps I just learned the real answer in that moment?

**Bob**: Come on, you're smarter than that. We *just* said that *there
was no answer yet.*

**Alice**: Maybe there was an answer! What if my friend saw it first?
She would know the real answer.

**Bob**: Yes, yes, Eugene Wigner tried this, too. It is
weird to think of a live human as being in a superposition, so maybe
conscious creatures collapse the wave function[4]. But let us avoid such
woo here! If the cat is dead, your friend sees that; if it is alive,
she sees that; both possibilities are still in superposition.

**Alice**: Ah, well if my friend can "split" then so can I! How about
this: the universe splits in two, with one "copy" of me seeing one
result, and the other "copy" seeing the other?

**Bob**: Yes, that's called the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation)
(MWI), but it doesn't solve anything[5]. For any "copy of you" --
henceforth, just "you" -- the cat's fate is still not decided until
*you* encounter it, directly or indirectly. It is as though the *truth*
comes into being simultaneously with your *knowledge* of it. You,
personally, and nobody else.

**Alice**: *[Smirking subtly]* That's absurd!

**Bob**: I have a feeling you know more than you're letting on, Alice.
But it gets worse: even if I discover now that the cat *has been dead*
for some time, *that* wasn't true a moment ago. The *history* of the
cat's fate comes into being in that moment. But then the past isn't
what I think it is. It's more like a back-story concocted to explain
the present.

**Alice**: And what exactly do you mean by "you" and "encounter" or
"knowledge" here?

**Bob**: Yes, that is tricky. If my *toe* encounters it first, then
in the microseconds it takes for the signal to propagate to "me",
the cat's fate *still* hasn't been settled. The toe is as external to
me as my friend is. So where, precisely, is this "me" that it has to
reach?

"Knowledge" is hard, too. Suppose the information only reaches me
very weakly, such as through a very faint reflection. If I only have
partial knowledge of the result, then in some sense the cat's fate is
only *partly* decided[6]. It is as though the more knowledgeable I am
of the result, the more real it is.

But then what happens if I *forget* the result so thoroughly that
my brain contains no trace of it[7]? Is the cat's fate "reset" for me?
I know I'm going way beyond our limited experimental data, but it is one
relatively straightforward extrapolation -- assuming you don't have any
metaphysical pre-commitments!

**Alice**: We will come back to this "forgetting" thing later. But what
does this all tell you?

**Bob**: Well, it's obvious *why* we yearn for some explanation -- be it
collapse, decoherence, many worlds, the consciousness of others, or
a thousand others -- to get us out of this mess. For all I know, one
of them will, and make a fool out of me. But part of me suspects that
isn't true... and, moreover, suspects that the physics community quietly
agrees.

  mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright
  hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.*

Either way, this perspective seems to be doing something useful for me.
When I confront it very squarely -- like you made me do for the "time
as an illusion" idea -- I end up in the same strange space as before.
My worldview briefly shatters.

#### Notes and references

[1] See the [double slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment),
for example.

[2] [Decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence) is
the phenomenon commonly invoked to explain why the cat is no longer in
a superposition, but this is a misunderstanding. It only explains why
we cannot demonstrate the superposition *in practice*. It does not deny
that it is there *in theory*.

> "Whenever a quantum system gets entangled with another system, its
coherence is reduced. However, the term 'decoherence' is typically
reserved to situations in which the loss of coherence is **effectively**
permanent and **difficult** to reverse or avoid."

[The decoherence myth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

See also [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/374212/118804).

This is also the heart of the misunderstanding of the double-slit
experiment and whether arbitrary physical systems can be called
"measuring devices." For more, see [here](quantum-bleep.html).

[3] See, e.g. [here](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2010/mar/18/quantum-effect-spotted-in-a-visible-object).

[4] See the [Wigner - von Neumann interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretation)
aka "consciousness causes collapse." As we saw from the opening quotes,
Wigner recognized fully well what would happen if he did *not* inject
this kind of deus ex machina.

[5] One argument might be that the worlds split before you see it,
and thus there *is* an answer already. But we do not make predictions
based on a vague notion of "worlds"; the state vector contains all
the information we need. And if you are *not* entangled with it, then
you are still capable of demonstrating the superposition, no matter the
interpretation regarding "worlds."

Another common argument is that there are still two answers *after* you
see it (with each copy of you seeing a different answer). But while this
"God's-eye view" may be true, it is irrelevant to (any copy of) you.

[6]
In layman's terms: a measuring device only destroys your ability to
detect interference insofar as the device can reliably tell apart the
two cases. If you were asleep when you "saw" the cat, and your brain
doesn't have reliable information, then you can treat it almost the same
as if you had never encountered it. This reliability is a spectrum.

More technically: a state `|0>|A> + |1>|B>` is decoherent (w.r.t the
first qubit) only insofar as `|A>` and `|B>` have small inner product.
Therefore if my brain states are largely indistinguishable in the two
cases, then the partial trace of the system w.r.t my brain is roughly
the same as before my brain became entangled with it, and it will still
exhibit (slightly weaker) interference.

The general idea is well established. See, e.g.
[here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/35049/118804). Whether it
applies to brains in the way described is, as usual, far beyond our
current ability to demonstrate.

[7] In other words, what if we could do a
[quantum eraser experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment)
with your brain? Again, we've only done it thus far for very small
systems, but we don't know of a theoretical limitation.
