### Act 5: Quantum woo

their minds in the following manner: they should realize as they vow
to save all sentient beings that in truth there are no sentient beings
to be saved ..."*

**Bob**: The experiment with time reminded me of something that always
bothered me about quantum physics.

**Alice**: Oh, no. Not this quantum woo-woo stuff!

**Bob**: No! You know I'm not that type. Despite over a hundred years of
arguing, the community doesn't agree on a formulation or interpretation.
I doubt we'll settle it here. But something occurred to me about *why*
it's so hard to agree. If you follow only orthodox, well-established
rules, you end up in a funny place.

> *I suspect that a substantial majority of physicists who use quantum
  mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright
  hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.*

**Alice**: Are you including
[wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)
as one of those rules?

**Bob**: Oh, no. That postulate exists to avoid the conclusion I'm about to
show you.

As you well know, under the usual unitary evolution rules,
Schrodinger's Cat is in a *superposition* before you see it. You cannot
say "the cat is *either* dead or alive"; both possibilities still exist.

**Alice**: How do we *know* they both exist? Why can't we say it's just one
or the other? I know with a single particle, we can do something called
an interference experiment[1]. I thought that was impossible for
cat-sized objects.

**Bob**: The relatively recent theory of *decoherence* explains why it is
very, very hard *in practice* for large objects, but it in no way
denies that they are there *in principle*. This is a common
misconception[2]. Though we are a far cry from a cat, we *have*
done such experiments on macroscopic objects[3], and see no fundamental
limits yet.

Now, what about *after* you encounter the cat? Tell me, if you
encountered a decomposing cat, would you feel comfortable saying that
it is, in fact, dead?

**Alice**: I don't know if "comfortable" is the right word, but of
course I would. Who wouldn't?

**Bob**: Okay. Now tell me, what changed in the moment you encountered
the cat? What enables you to say it has a well-defined fate now, when
you couldn't before?

**Alice**: Because I didn't know the real answer yet?

**Bob**: Come on, you're smarter than that. We *just* said that *there
was no answer yet.*

**Alice**: Maybe there was an answer! What if my friend saw it first?
She would know the real answer.

**Bob**: Yes, Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner tried doing this, too. It is
weird to think of a live human as being in a superposition, so maybe
conscious creatures collapse the wave function[4]. Let's not devolve
into such woo here. If the cat is dead, your friend sees that; if it is
alive, she sees that; both possibilities are still in superposition.

**Alice**: Ah, well if my friend can "split" then so can I. How about
this: the universe splits in two, with one "copy" of me seeing one
result, and the other "copy" seeing the other.

**Bob**: Yes, that's called the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation)
(MWI), but it doesn't solve anything[5]. For any "copy of you" --
henceforth, just just "you" -- the cat's fate is not decided until
*you* encounter it (either directly or indirectly). Somehow the *truth*
comes into being simultaneously with your *knowledge* of it. It is as
though you are the only sentient being in your world -- i.e., the thing
you normally just call "*the* world."

**Alice**: *[Smirking subtly]* That's absurd!

**Bob**: I have a feeling you know more than you're letting on, Alice.
But it gets worse: even if the cat *has been dead* for some time, it
wasn't true a moment ago. The *history* of the cat comes into being
simultaneously with your knowledge of it.

**Alice**: And what exactly do you mean by "you" and "knowledge" or
"encounter" here?

**Bob**: Yes, that is tricky too. If my *toe* encounters it, but that
signal has somehow not reached "me" yet, then the cat's fate *still*
hasn't been settled. So what, precisely, is this "I"? I don't know.
I'm beginning to think that maybe Edward Witten was right[6].

**Alice**: So what does this all tell you?

**Bob**: Well, being a physicist, I'd obviously prefer that one of the
many alternative theories pans out. If geocentricity was bad, and
human-centricity was worse, where does that put me-centricity? Even if
there were no objective reasons to seek a different theory,
psychological reasons would force that mission upon us. Er... me.

Nonetheless, this perspective seems to be doing something useful for me.
When I confront it very squarely -- like you made me do for
the "time as an illusion" idea -- I end up in the same strange space as
before. My worldview briefly crumbles.

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

[4] See the [Wigner - von Neumann interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretation)
aka "consciousness causes collapse."

However, there's good reason to believe that he championed this idea
to avoid an even uglier possibility:

> This takes place whenever the result of an observation enters the
  consciousness of the observer - or, to be even more painfully precise,
  my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people
  being only subjects of my observations.

...

> However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
  extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
  people, in their hearts, will go along with it.

[5] One argument might be that the worlds split before you see it,
and thus there *is* an answer already. But we do not make predictions
based on "worlds"; the state vector is sufficient. And if you are *not*
entangled with it, then you are still capable of demonstrating the
superposition, no matter the interpretation regarding "worlds."

his fellow theoretical physicists casually throw around terms like
["smarter than anyone else"](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/magazine/a-theory-of-everything.html?pagewanted=all)
and "head and shoulders above the rest":

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected
with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that
has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum
mechanics and its applications to the universe.*

> *Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make
sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the
observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely
uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash
with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics,
and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go
away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.*
