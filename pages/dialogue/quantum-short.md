Nobody likes the measurement problem. It's hard to even reason precisely
about it. It is easy to think, for example, that decoherence or the
many-worlds interpretation solves it. They do not.

Here I hope to convey why.

I'm going to work backwards, for the benefit of readers already familiar
with the basics. If the redux and conclusion make no sense to you, or
this is your first time with QM, or you want a refresher, it's worth 
reading the "Intro to QM" section below.

**Caveat**: I am not a physicist but a software engineer who has studied
some QM.

### The problem, redux

Suppose you do an experiment that starts out with a single well-isolated 
particle in a superposition. It slowly gets entangled with a few other
particles, and then eventually that superposition grows out into 
the environment and reaches you.

Note for MWI adherents: when in doubt, every usage of "you" here refers 
to "one copy of you." This mental substitution should not be too onerous, 
since you conveniently happen to *be* one copy of you. Similarly, "world" 
refers to just your branch. I do this to demonstrate that the problem
exists despite what the God's-eye picture is.

1. There is a time before which it is not meaningful to say that there
is just one result.

   For example, when the system is still one or a few well-controlled 
   particles, you can demonstrate the superposition via an interference 
   experiment.

2. There is a time beyond which it *is* meaningful to say that there
is one result.

   For example, once you've seen it, you can say that there is one.

3. Therefore there is **some particular point** at which a well-defined
result *comes into existence* in your world, in a physically verifiable 
sense.

   This is the point at which Schrodinger's Cat's fate is sealed.
   
   Before this point, if you say there *is* a result, there exists an
   interference experiment that would make you a liar. After this point,
   if you say there is *no* result, there is a decomposing cat that will 
   make you a liar.

Decoherence explains why it is *practically* impossible to demonstrate 
superposition beyond a certain point, but does not suggest that it ever
becomes *theoretically* impossible. Thus it cannot provide the
necessary boundary[1]. In any case, if we ever discover such a point, it 
would be physically indistinguishable from a "real collapse" for you.

To avoid harming any sensibilities, I will refer to the "some particular
point" as "collapse" (in quotes).

This leaves only the question: when does this "collapse" happen?
Whatever other conditions it must meet, note that it is upper-bounded by 
when you, personally, see the result. This leaves room for a few
possibilities.

---

## Possible solutions

1. "Collapse" is a real event that happens somewhere and somewhen.

   Because it always happens by the time you see it, either you must
be able to cause it, or it happens at very small scales (to prevent you
from getting inside the boundary).

   We have not found evidence for such a thing. MWI exists to avoid the
   idea entirely. Even most Copenhagenists don't seem to take collapse
   literally.

2. *You* am the point at which "the truth comes into being." 
Schrodinger's Cat only has a well-defined fate in my world when you, 
personally, see it.

   In MWI without "collapse," this seems to be the inevitable conclusion. 
   From the perspective of any copy of you, their encountering the 
   system is the point at which the result comes into being.

3. QM itself needs modification. This is the aim of competing theories
like [de Broglie - Bohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory). Nobody seems to like these
too much[5].

In other words: collapse, solipsism, or QM is wrong.

(Actually, my own interpretation is that there is no "you" in the way
you think; the stuff of conscious experience *is* the world; our various 
perspectives happen neither sequentially nor in parallel, time being
illusory; and the point of this game is for consciousness to awaken to 
itself. More on that later.)

### Intro to QM

This is a brief recap of some core features of QM. We will
assume as few things as possible, relying only on experimental data, 
so that you can see for yourself why the community cannot agree on what 
adjustments are necessary.

In particular, we will not be assuming [wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse), as it is just one
possible solution.

1. A particle can be in a kind of combination of two states, called a
"superposition." For example, a particle may be in a superposition of
spin-up and spin-down. Or going-left and going-right. Or vertically-polarized and horizontally-polarized. Etc.

2. It is possible to do what's called an *interference experiment* on
this particle, which can
conclusively demonstrate that the particle is in a superposition, and
not just merely "in one state but we don't know which."

3. When that particle encounters another particle, and the second
particle's behavior depends on the first's, the two become *entangled.*
Examples:

   * If the second particle would block a vertically polarized
photon but transmit a horizontally polarized one, then the polarized 
particle becomes entangled with the filter when they meet. 

   * If the 
second particle would move left when bumped by a going-left particle 
and move right when bumped by a moving-right one, then the two become 
entangled.
  
   In this sense, entanglement is just the normal laws of physics 
   applied to each "branch" of the superposition. 
  
4. The entangled particles are now together in a superposition, e.g. 
"particle is vertically polarized and filter absorbed it + particle is 
horizontally
polarized and filter transmitted it." This superposition is demonstrable
(in an interference experiment) only insofar as we have precise control 
over *both* particles[2]. 

   This means that there is still no definite result yet.

5. This process is not limited to two particles. As more particles get 
involved, the same process occurs with each of them. They join the
superposition. We need precise control of *all* of them to do an
interference experiment.

   In the two-slit experiment, we don't have precise control over every
particle of the detector, so we lose the *practical* ability to demonstrate 
interference. That's why we don't see an interference pattern; it has
nothing to do with detectors being conscious. This is only a 
*practical* limitation[3].

   In theory, the
particle + detector system is in superposition. Once it strikes
the screen, the particle + detector + screen are in superposition. There
are still two branches in the system.

6. As trillions of stray photons, air molecules, etc. get involved, our 
*practical*
ability to demonstrate the superposition through interference is 
hopelessly dashed. This fact is called *decoherence[1].*

   **But the ability is still there *in principle.*** And as long as the 
   theory says it is there *in principle*, we are *not* free to say "the 
   electron went through one slit but we don't know which," even if it's a 
   fine approximation for all *practical* purposes.

   This conflation of "in practice" and "in principle" is where it's 
easiest to lose the plot.

   As a side note: we *have* done experiments with trillions of particles
-- enough to be visible to the naked eye -- where we did have control,
and we *could* exhibit interference, as predicted.[4]

7. Once I see the result, I certainly *can* say it went through exactly
one slit (because I see which one it is). It is not just hard but
*nonsensical* within any formulation of the theory to say it is in 
superposition at this point. The ability is lost *in principle* within
this world.

   The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) says that there is another world in
which I see the other result, and so both possibilities still remain.
This is true but irrelevant for our present purposes. For a *single copy
of you* -- which "you" always are -- the above fact remains. In your
world, there is no more superposition.

   This is another place where it's easy to lose the plot.

[1] [Decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence) is
the phenomenon commonly invoked to explain why the cat is no longer in
a superposition, but this is a misunderstanding. It only explains why
we cannot demonstrate the superposition *in practice*. It does not deny
that it is there *in principle*.

Roger Penrose (2004), The Road to Reality, pp. 802-803:
> ...the environmental-decoherence viewpoint ... maintains that state 
vector reduction can be understood as coming about because the
environmental system under consideration becomes inextricably entangled
with its environment.[...] We think of the environment as extremely
complicated and essentially 'random' [... but] there is no general 
principle providing an
absolute bar to extracting information from the environment.[...]
Accordingly, such descriptions are referred to as FAPP [For All Practical
Purposes].

[The decoherence myth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

This note is for the reader who is already well-acquainted with
QM (but is not necessarily acquainted with the [density
matrix formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix)). We
will omit normalization constants.

Consider a qubit in state `|psi> = |0> + |1>` measured with respect to
the following basis:

`{ |A> = |0> + |1>, |B> = |0> - |1> }`

Note that because `<B|psi> = 0`, the result will never be `B`. This
result can be interpreted as the result of interference. In particular,
`<B|0>` and `<B|1>` (the "two paths" from `|psi>` to `|B>`) have
opposite amplitudes and are said to "destructively interfere."

Now let the qubit become entangled with a "measuring device":

`|psi'> = |0>|X> + |1>|Y>`

With `|X>` and `|Y>` also orthornormal.

If you calculate the probability of `|psi'>` being measured as `|B>`
(e.g., by applying the projector `P_B @ I`), you will find that it is
50%, as would be predicted if the particle were in a *classically*
indeterminate mixture of `|0>` and `|1>`. The interference has
"disappeared" with respect to either sub-system alone. In the density
matrix formulation, this is equivalent to taking the
[partial trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_trace) and
noticing that the off-diagonal terms have disappeared.

On the other hand, because `|psi'>` is still just a superposition
(in the tensor-product space spanned by
`{ |0>|X>, |0>|Y>, |1>|X>, |1>|Y> }`),
we can still demonstrate interference on it (e.g., by noting that it
is never measured as `|0>|X> - |1>|Y>` or by undoing the entanglement).
This requires control of both systems.

Another interesting thing to note is that the interference on `psi`
disappears only insofar as `|X>` and `|Y>` have a smaller inner product.

[3] We can do a similar experiment
where the "detector" is something we *do* have precise control over,
in which case we can recover the interference pattern. This is the basis
of the [quantum eraser experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment).

Beyond some point we run into decoherence (see note [1]).
