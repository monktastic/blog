A: You are not conscious.

B: Nice try. You already equipped me with the tools I need to confirm
that I am, in fact, conscious.

A: No, you have misunderstood. Your tools only allows you to confirm
that *there is consciousness.*

B: But obviously it's mine. Who else's would it be?

A: What does it *mean* for it to be yours? Here, let's try this thought
experiment. Suppose I replace your visual field with Barack Obama's.
Whatever he's seeing, you're now seeing.

B: Okay...

A: And one by one, I replace the rest of your sense fields with his.

B: It's a little hard to imagine, but I'm following.

A: Good. Finally, I replace your *mental* field. You're no longer experiencing
Bob's thoughts and memories and emotions, but Obama's.

B: Now it feels like I simply *am* Obama.

A: Indeed. So why wouldn't you now say that "Obama is conscious?"

B: Because it's actually *me* behind the scenes.

A: But from your perspective as Obama, you don't know that. Obama's
not thinking "I'm Bob behind the scenes," is he? Just like when you're
Bob, you have no way of knowing whether it's "actually" someone else
"behind the scenes," right?

B: Hmm, I guess so.

A: Great, now come back to being Bob. Can you see

You are not conscious.

Buddha as a dream
