I've just learned that Kubernetes "Helm" is a great technology "to find, share, 
and use software built for Kubernetes" and decide I want to use it. First stop
is [their documentation](http://helm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/awesome). There
I learn that the `manifests/` directory is one of three key components. It's
a place to store your Kubernetes manifests.

What is a Kubernetes manifest? Nobody really knows.

(Sorry for the PDFs. Jekyll chokes on the saved webpages.)

Seriously, how does anyone get anything done?
