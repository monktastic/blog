## Superposition

A particle has many properties: spin, charge, position, momentum, etc. Let's 
consider spin. We must first pick an axis (x, y, or z) and then measure the spin 
along that axis. When we do, we get one of two values: *up* or *down*. If we
choose *x* and find that it is *up*, we may say that the particle is in the 
state *x-up*.

We know (from many experiments) that if a particle is in *x-up*, and we then
measure its spin along *y*, the outcome will be randomly either *up* or *down*
with equal probability. The state then *becomes* *y-up* or *y-down*, respectively.
At this point, we can no longer say anything concrete about the spin in the 
***x*** direction. This is very important, but we won't dwell on it here.

We *also* know from experiments that if the particle had instead been in 
*x-down*, then the subsequent *y* measurement would have followed the very same 
distribution: 50-50.

Now suppose our friend hands us a particle and tells us:

> I know that if you measure this along the *x-axis*, it will come out *up* with
50% probability and *down* with 50% probability. 

Does this allow us to predict anything about the outcome of a measurement in the 
***y*** direction? We ought to be able to reason as follows:

> Well there are only two cases: it's either in *x-up* or *x-down*, and in
*both* cases, the outcome of the *y* measurement would be 50-50. Therefore,
the overall outcome is clearly 50-50.

Such reasoning would be correct in the classical case. In the quantum case,
there are other possibilities. For example, if the particle is *already* in
the state *y-up*, then we know (again, from experiments) that a measurement in
along the *x*-axis would be distributed 50-50. This outcome would agree with our
friend's claim, and yet if we were to measure it instead along *y*, it would be
a guaranteed *up* (and not the 50-50 split we had reasoned through above).

If this is getting confusing, don't worry. The takeaway message is this:
