title: Transcending metaphysics
description: What remains when you stop believing?

> "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." --
Philip K Dick

## Summary

* You believe in the past because it is *convenient*, not because it
is *logically justified.*

* Even if you understand this intellectually, it will still *feel* like
time exists.

* You think this feeling is imposed externally, but actually you are
*creating* it. It is incredibly valuable to see *how* you are creating it.

* To do so, you will need to "root your mind" and gain access to the
layers that give rise to your metaphysics. What you find underneath
will surprise you.

* There are large practical benefits that are easy to communicate.

* There are even larger benefits which can only sound like lunacy until
you have at least partially unveiled the metaphysical machinery.

## Unpacked

### Radical skepticism

As far as you know, the world popped into existence *just now*. Your
first instinct may be to say "okay, that's *possible*, but it's very
*improbable*." You [will find](pages/radical-skepticism.html), however,
that this claim can only be justified by circular reasoning. Instead,
your belief in a real past is purely a *preference*.

At first, this may seem like a pointless argument: *okay, but so what?*
This document is about the "so what?"


### Layers of mind

The mind is made up of many layers. Normally we only have access to
very superficial layers, in which our conscious thought is
unfolding. Your thoughts as you read this reside in these upper layers.

When you begin to meditate, you will discover layers of thought that
you normally do not notice but are nonetheless consciously accessible.
A good analogy is when you are reading a book, only to discover
that your eyes have been scanning the page while your mind was
elsewhere. Those thoughts are consciously accessible, but below the
threshold of awareness.

You have many thousands of such thoughts a day. If you learned to notice
them, a lot of your mood and personality could be understood on a level
that is not possible otherwise. This accounts for the commonly
recognized benefits of meditation.

### What lies beneath

If you keep digging, you will discover the extremely subtle mental
processes that give rise to your experience of reality itself, and
discover how they are self-reinforcing. The mind labels an experience
as "memory," which it takes as evidence for a real past. Being such a
deep layer of mind, that conclusion manifests as a visceral *experience
of* time. This produces the illusion that the experience is happening
*to you* (rather than you fabricating it), and this "external
validation" provides justification for itself.

In a remarkable twist, you discover that your metaphysics is not
*false,* per se: rather, *it is true because you make it so*.

At this point, the smokescreen is woven tightly enough that it can
trivially parry intellectual attacks from higher layers. Behold the
dazzling array of techniques your mind is currently employing to
disbelieve what is written here. There is a **profoundly meaningful**
sense in which our own mind gives rise to the entire
thing-we-call-reality (henceforth, just "reality"),
but without seeing it for ourselves, the most we are willing to do is
approximate this with something like "there is a *real* reality, and our
*brain* gives rise to our personal experience of it." This is a powerful
defense mechanism, and you should be grateful for it.

What remains when you stop believing cannot be put into words, and
whatever approximation you are forming right now is hopelessly
inaccurate.

### The glory

If you manage to stop taking reality for granted for even a moment, it
is felt as profoundly liberating. This is similar to not taking some
particular thing (say, your health) for granted, but *infinitely* more
expansive. It is as though you are repeatedly overwhelmed with the
incomprehensible miracle of existence, and are suddenly free to
reinterpret life events in a healthier context.

The sheer glory, awe, and wonder can only be approximated with very
low fidelity while remaining shoehorned inside your worldview, such as
when you are in awe of a scientific theory. And even
when we do have a genuinely transcendent experience, our mind rushes
to fit it into a framework (whether scientific or religious).

As you put your world in a healthier context, things in life often seem
to work out better. You utterly forgive your wife for a long-held
grudge, and she suddenly becomes more loving. Sometimes this kind of
thing happens even when your worldview cannot accommodate it: your wife
was halfway around the world, and you hadn't even communicated.

### The mission

You are confronted with a choice: do I stay comfy in my metaphysics
and potentially circumscribe the degree of healing that is possible,
or do I venture out into the unknown? Do I continue to fabricate a
world in which such things have never happened, giving me the evidence
I need to demonstrate that they can't?

How you respond will depend on your training and readiness.

### The path

Insanity is what occurs when the deepest layers of mind are generating
a reality that higher layers refuse to align with. It is a distinct
possibility if you try to force your way into realization without
preparation, such as taking psychedelics for the "wrong reasons."

The mission laid out by the Buddha (amongst others) is to progressively
but completely relax this death-grip on our worldview and see for
ourselves what remains. It would be absurd to believe you have any
such ability without significant practice. A high IQ can easily be used
to strengthen the mind's deceptions. Luckily, in conjunction with
meditation, there are many complementary practices we can employ:
radical gratitude, radical forgiveness, radical self-compassion....
