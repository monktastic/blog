We explore reasons for not taking your worldview so dead seriously.

---

[Radical skepticism](radical-skepticism.html)

Your belief in time is based entirely on circular reasoning. As such,
it has **no** justification other than "it feels good." Yet, you feel
powerfully compelled to see it as Truth.

Why? What compels you to believe in space, time, and brains? Try to
answer without reference to those things.

[Layers of mind](layers-of-mind.html)

Deep layers of your mind (not your "brain," mind you) are responsible
for turning a belief in time into the *experience* of time, which is
taken as evidence for the belief. This powerful feedback loop explains
both the compulsion to believe and the repeated attempt to use circular
reasoning to justify it.

We discover that materialism is not *false*; it is true *because you
make it true*.

[Consciousness](consciousness.html)

Consciousness is the potential that manifests as beliefs, thoughts, and
the experiences that you lump together as "reality." Whether or not this
is true in an ultimate sense, it is a valuable insight to experience.
One comes to see more deeply the structure of belief and experience.

The knot of materiality loosens further.

[QM and the measurement problem](quantum.html)

We discover that the foundational question of quantum mechanics is
not so much "solved" as "swept under the rug" in modern treatments.
When reasoned carefully, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that *you*
are the sole observer in your universe.
