title: Idealism in a nutshell
description:
---

Perhaps you've encountered ideas like
"[love is the purpose of existence](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html),"
and though maybe some tiny part of you wishes they were true, the more
logical parts of your mind acknowledge that they're nonsense or pure
fantasy. You're sophisticated, and understand that the universe is
really just a random collection of dead matter that has somehow
self-organized into bits that amuse themselves with romantic notions to
avoid the harsh truth.

If you actually *enjoy* this narrative, then by all means, carry on.

If you don't do it because you *like* it, but because you've become
convinced that it's the unavoidable Truth, then you might like to play
around with some of the ideas here.

### The setup

There is *a meaningful sense* in which seemingly physical reality is
entirely a manifestation of your mind.

I'll use the phrase "a meaningful
sense" repeatedly in this series.

If you are forced to choose between taking some of these insights
*literally* or rejecting them, your mind will often choose to reject
them. For example, it would be scary to believe that the past
*literally* never happened, so your mind will pretend it doesn't
understand or care.

On the other hand, if you don't take them seriously enough,
you will miss the point entirely. For example, you might think "oh, he
means *my brain* gives rise to *my experience of* reality." But that
is very much *not* what I mean, and this habit of interpreting
everything in terms of your existing beliefs is *precisely* the habit
we are trying to undermine.

Similarly, the word "God" *does* point to something meaningful, but
that something cannot be recognized from within your usual conceptual
structures. At the same time, you do not have to *abandon* those
structures; you merely have to see through them.

For these insights to be of any use, you will have to discover what
happens when you take them as literally true. Only then can you really
see what they are pointing at. It's sort of like lining up the

[Radical skepticism](radical-skepticism.html)

Based on evidence and logic alone, you have no reason to believe in
the existence of time. You cannot even say it is "likely" that
time exists without making assumptions that can only be justified by
presupposing time. Belief in time is thus *pure preference*.

If you can consider this fact with total openness -- "the past may
genuinely be an illusion, and I cannot even say that this is '*unlikely*'"
-- then you may experience a brief "oh, sh*t" moment. This is a tiny
incision in your worldview. The self-healing mechanism will repair it
very rapidly, but not completely.

<!-- Why couldn't this all be a trick of the brain? -->


This does *not* entitle you to open the floodgates to all
manner of [woo-woo](http://skepdic.com/woowoo.html). Instead, it might
allow you to open up to the question: are there *other* models of
reality that are in accordance with observed data, and as logically
consistent as my current one? What happens if I adopt them?

1. Logic (time is pure preference)
2. Empiricism (love and consciousness)

The world goes the way you intend.

How does this make you feel?

* It doesn't matter how I *feel* dammit, what matters is the real truth
out there.

Excellent. Now review why you have *no reason* to believe in such a
thing. How does that make you feel?

Your belief in time is based entirely on circular reasoning. As such,
it has **no** justification other than "it feels good." Yet, you feel
powerfully compelled to see it as Truth.

Why? What compels you to believe in space, time, and brains? Try to
answer without reference to those things.

[Layers of mind](layers-of-mind.html)

Deep layers of your mind (not your "brain," mind you) are responsible
for turning a belief in time into the *experience* of time, which is
taken as evidence for the belief. This powerful feedback loop explains
both the compulsion to believe and the repeated attempt to use circular
reasoning to justify it.

We discover that materialism is not *false*; it is true *because you
make it true*.

[Consciousness](consciousness.html)

Consciousness is the potential that manifests as beliefs, thoughts, and
the experiences that you lump together as "reality." Whether or not this
is true in an ultimate sense, it is a valuable insight to experience.
One comes to see more deeply the structure of belief and experience.

The knot of materiality loosens further.

[QM and the measurement problem](quantum.html)

We discover that the foundational question of quantum mechanics is
not so much "solved" as "swept under the rug" in modern treatments.
When reasoned carefully, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that *you*
are the sole observer in your universe.
