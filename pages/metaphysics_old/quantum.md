## Preface

There is a thorny problem in quantum physics known as the "measurement
problem." While a firm grasp of QM is required to understand all the
details, the central issue can be explained satisfactorily to anyone
willing to think about it carefully.

It is not thorny because of the math, but because the philosophical
implications can be deeply uncomfortable.
Caltech physicist [Sean Carroll](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/23/physicists-should-stop-saying-silly-things-about-philosophy/):
```
I suspect that a substantial majority of physicists who use quantum
mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright
hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.
```

If you hear only secondhand accounts -- either from those who think it
opens the door to all manner of woo-woo, or from those who consider the
issue mundane and resolved -- you will miss out on one of the most
fascinating puzzles in history.

This is from Edward Witten, a physicist so overpoweringly smart that
his fellow theoretical physicists casually throw around terms like
["smarter than anyone else"](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/magazine/a-theory-of-everything.html?pagewanted=all)
and "head and shoulders above the rest":
```
I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected
with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that
has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum
mechanics and its applications to the universe.

Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make
sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the
observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely
uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash
with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics,
and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go
away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.
```

I would like to explain the issue as clearly as I can.
After grappling with the problem yourself, you may come to appreciate
why most would prefer to leave this particular can of worms closed.

As this article is part of a series on metaphysical idealism, you
should be unsurprised by my own conclusion. Nonetheless, I advise you to
draw your own.

### Required background

As background, you must understand the famous two-slit experiment.
If you don't already know it, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc)
is a clip from the New Age movie "What The Bleep Do We Know?" While
it does a great job of communicating the experiment, we will also
briefly look at why its conclusions are bogus. In a twist of irony,
it misses the real punchline, which is far more bizarre than the
clip suggests.

## Modeling the world

This will require a bit of math, but I'm going to simplify the notation.
In the two-slit experiment, when the electron (`E`) encounters the
screen, it can go one of two ways (left or right). We normally
write this:

`|E_left> + |E_right>`

Let us take some liberties, replacing the symbols with words. "Or" is
not technically precise, but it will do for our present purposes:

`E left or E right`

At this point it is possible to detect the "or" by means of an
interference experiment. This is what causes the light and dark bands.

Now, if a detector (`D`) is placed at the slits, then the state becomes:

`(E left and D left) or (E right and D right)`

You don't see a term like `E left and D right` because that would
just indicate a faulty detector.

One side-effect is that `E` by itself will no longer show interference.
The light/dark bands vanish. On the other hand, there *is* in theory an
experiment that would demonstrate interference on the `E`-`D` *joint*
system, but it's very hard to do in practice, and not easy to
describe[5].

If `D` were a single particle, and we had precise control over both `E`
and `D`, then we could actually do this in the lab. In fact, this is the
general principle behind quantum computing, which today we can only do
with a very small number of carefully controlled particles[7]. That
number is growing every day, and we have no evidence that there is a
theoretical ceiling.

This theoretical ability to demonstrate interference is important. It is
what allows us to say "it's not that the system is in one state but we
don't know which; it is still in a *combination* of those states." Until
you've seen the result of the experiment (directly or indirectly), it
is not meaningful to say that the electron "actually" went one way.
This will become important later.

This is the point at which some people lose the plot. See, for example,
the [4:25 mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc) from
the clip in the intro:
```
The electron decided to act differently, as though it was aware that
it was being watched!
```
Sounds spooky, right? They even give the detector an eyeball with
creepy eyelashes. But it didn't "decide" anything and it wasn't "aware"
of anything -- unless you also think a pool ball is "aware" of the
cue ball hitting it and "decides" to move as a result. It's really
just straightforward physics and math, although some misunderstand
and think that detectors must be conscious.

The detector has in *one* sense "measured" the electron: in each
"branch" of the superposition, the detector is correctly displaying
the electron's path. But from *your* perspective, there is no reason
to say that one outcome has actually occurred, and in this important
sense you should not consider it "measured." This is the second way
in which people commonly lose the plot.

Anyway, as objects (such as the detector) interact with the experiment,
they become part of it. When the electron hits the
screen (`S`), the screen registers it on the left or right:

`(E left and D left and S left) or (E right and D right and S right)`

And so on. *Every* physical object that encounters the system gets
"split" in two, joining the superposition. It is as though there are
two "branches" to the experiment, evolving in parallel.

If this is so, then when does the `or` disappear? When do you get to say
there is really one answer?

## The measurement problem

This is the heart of the so-called "measurement problem" in QM, and
there are a few attempts at answering it. I'll share two of the more
common.

#### Collapse

One possibility is that "something" causes the system to suddenly
and randomly collapse from two branches to one. The problem is, there
doesn't seem to be anything that could qualify as that "something," since all
physical systems (as far as we know) simply join the superposition.
Not only that, but going from two to one loses information, which goes
squarely against everything we know about physics[4].

The collapse idea is a sort of deus ex machina, and I think it lives
on mostly for practical reasons, sidestepping the philosophical issues.

##### Consciousness causes collapse?

In 1967 Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner famously proposed a thought
experiment suggesting that not only does collapse occur, but only
*conscious beings* cause it. Imagine that your friend encounters
the experiment before you do. The math suggests that she "splits" and
joins the superposition (like any other physical system):

 `(E left and D left and ... and Friend sees left) or (... right)`

Notice how `Friend` appears in both branches, just like everything else.
Wigner felt that this
"appears absurd because it implies that my friend was in a state of
suspended animation."[1] "Clearly" she must see one outcome or the
other! Therefore, she must have collapsed the state into one,
for example:

`E left and D left and ... and Friend sees left`

The "or" has disappeared. The idea that humans have the magical property
of being the only things in the universe that can cause "collapse" is
widely considered bogus, but as we shall soon see, Wigner's argument
was actually more nuanced than that.

#### Many worlds

Another popular answer, known as the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)
is that the two *never* become one. The world-eating superposition
grows *forever*. If that is the case, why do I see only one result?
Simple: *I don't!* Once I encounter the experiment, "one copy" of me
sees one result, and another copy sees the other result:

`(E and D and S and Me left) or (... right)`

In other words: there were two possibilities before you saw it, but
there are still two after you see it. Each copy of you *thinks* there's
only one, but that's only because they don't have the full picture. So
there's nothing to explain!

Problem neatly solved, right?

Not so fast. Consider how things look for "one copy of you."

*Before* you encounter the experiment, you are *not* entitled to say
that "one result has *actually* happened but I don't know which."
Standard QM is very clear on this, and MWI does not deny it[3].
Both possibilities are there. *There is no meaningful sense in which
there is a "real answer" yet.*

*After* you see it, yes, there *is* a well-defined sense in which there
are still two possibilities. The question you must answer for yourself
is: is there *any meaningful sense* in which there is now only one? In
other words, when confronted with a
[decomposing cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat),
are you entitled to say "yes, this cat is *really* dead?"

If so, what exactly happened in the moment you saw it? What changed,
for you to be able to say "this cat is really dead" when a moment ago
you could not? You may be tempted to say "I gained knowledge of the
answer," but as we took pains to point out, *there was no answer* a
moment ago (as far as QM suggests).

(And if you answered "no," then congratulations: I dub thee
*quantum physicist*. Now
[shut up and calculate](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Shut_up_and_calculate).)

The conclusion is strange but unavoidable[8]: the reality of the cat's
fate came into being simultaneously with you discovering it, in some
meaningful (if *very slippery* to pin down) sense. And not your friend,
either. *You*.

And it's not just the occasional electron or cat. *Everything
in existence*, everything around you, obeys the laws of QM.

MWI has not solved the problem; it has only gotten worse.

<!-- Parallel with the time realization. This isn't to convince you,
but for you to stare directly into something: what if this is really
true?
-->


## The measurement problem, take two

Let's take a step back and re-examine the measurement problem. It asks,
basically, "why do we see only one outcome, when the math predicts two?"
But it's not really "we"; it's "me." I am really asking, "why do *I*
experience just one world?"

The measurement problem is a question about my *experience* of the
world. It should come as no surprise then that any answer to it will be
closely connected to the question of experience, i.e., consciousness.

We saw that something happens when "I encounter" the system,
but notice what happens when we try to pin that down. What if my *toe*
encounters the experiment? No reason "I" can't treat it like any other
physical system and preserve the two branches[6]. The change happens
when the experiment encounters... "I."

But where *exactly* do we find this I?

This is just the question of consciousness in drag. And not just *any*
consciousness; *my* consciousness. We see that Wigner already understood
this well[2]:
```
This takes place whenever the result of an observation enters the
consciousness of the observer - or, to be even more painfully precise,
my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people
being only subjects of my observations.
```

Not that he particularly endorsed this conclusion:
```
However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
people, in their hearts, will go along with it.
```

But to avoid the conclusion of being the only observer, he had to
inject other acrobatics -- ones that we can, in principle, falsify.
MWI does a better job of hiding this sleight of hand, but ultimately
falls, too.

If you carefully avoid sweeping things under the rug, and follow the
empirical and theoretical results closely, it is hard to avoid this
conclusion: *your* encountering the world is, in some sense,
*the* point at which the world becomes unified.

You can call it "my world" if that softens the blow, but it is the
very same thing that you know of as "the world": *the world* is always
*your world*.

## You and consciousness

Okay, so consciousness is not a property that other people have. But
actually, it is not even a property that *you* have.

Instead, as we saw [here](consciousness.html), consciousness usefully be
thought of as the very *fabric* from which your reality is made. In
its present configuration, it is manifesting "your perspective." This
is an experiential realization that doesn't rely on or support QM, but
meshes with it quite naturally.

Looked at in this way, it should come as no surprise that this is where
the rubber meets the road: it is precisely where the world is made
"real."

This may shed some light on why such brilliant thinkers as Ed Witten
do not believe that consciousness will become part of physics (or
biology or neuroscience...). Physics is about *things*, and *things*
rigidly obey the laws of QM. "Consciousness" does not refer to a
*thing* in this sense, but the remarkable fact that this theoretical
sea of things somehow becomes *real*.

As much as we try to deny it, it seems Wigner had it right all along:
```
it will remain remarkable, in whatever way our future concepts may
develop, that the very study of the external world led to the conclusion
that the content of the consciousness is an ultimate reality.
```

[3] Sometimes "[decoherence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/)"
is raised as an objection. Put simply it says:
```
Once the experiment is exposed to the environment, there are untold
trillions of photons and air molecules interacting with it, and it is
practically impossible to track them all. The human body alone has
~10^28 particles! So it is in practice impossible to demonstrate the
superposition, and we should not call it one.
```

The astute reader will notice the weasel word "practically." Decoherence
is a powerfully useful framework for explaining why relative cavemen
like we are incapable of *demonstrating* macroscopic superpositions --
in other words, why the two branches never interfere in practice --
but it does not deny that they are still there *in principle*.

See also Roger Penrose (2004), The Road to Reality, pp. 802-803:
```
...the environmental-decoherence viewpoint ... maintains that state vector
reduction [the R process] can be understood as coming about because the
environmental system under consideration becomes inextricably entangled
with its environment.[...] We think of the environment as extremely
complicated and essentially 'random' [...] Under normal circumstances,
one must regard the density matrix as some kind of approximation to the
whole quantum truth. For there is no general principle providing an
absolute bar to extracting information from the environment.[...]
Accordingly, such descriptions are referred to as FAPP [For All Practical
Purposes]
...
Maybe a future technology could provide means whereby quantum phase
relations can be monitored in detail, under circumstances where
present-day technology would simply ‘give up’. It would seem that the
resort to a density-matrix description is a technology-dependent
prescription! With better technology, the state-vector description
could be maintained for longer, and the resort to a density matrix put
off until things get really hopelessly messy!
```

Also see [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/374212/118804).
Nonetheless, the [myth persists](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):
```
Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.
```

As an aside: the fact that it is hard in practice is what makes quantum
computing so challenging to implement.

[4] [Leonard Susskind](https://youtu.be/iNgIl-qIklU?t=3m3s), relating
how he and Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft disproved an idea of Stephen
Hawking:
```
In fact, I think of it as more basic than any of the other principles
of physics. The most basic principle of physics is that distinctions
never disappear.
```

[5] This note is for the reader who is already well-acquainted with
QM (but is not necessarily acquainted with the [density
matrix formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix)). We
will omit normalization constants.

Consider a qubit in state `|psi> = |0> + |1>` measured with respect to
the following basis:

`{ |A> = |0> + |1>, |B> = |0> - |1> }`

Note that because `<B|psi> = 0`, the result will never be `B`. This
result can be interpreted as the result of interference. In particular,
`<B|0>` and `<B|1>` (the "two paths" from `|psi>` to `|B>`) have
opposite amplitudes and are said to "destructively interfere."

Now let the qubit become entangled with a "measuring device":

`|psi'> = |0>|X> + |1>|Y>`

If you calculate the probability of `|psi'>` being measured as `|B>`
(e.g., by applying the projector `P_B @ I`), you will find that it is
50%, as would be predicted if the particle were in a classically
indeterminate mixture of `|0>` and `|1>`. The interference has
"disappeared" with respect to either sub-state alone. In the density
matrix formulation, this is equivalent to taking the
[partial trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_trace) and
noticing that the off-diagonal terms have disappeared.

On the other hand, because `|psi'>` is still just a superposition
(in the tensor-product space spanned by
`{ |0>|X>, |0>|Y>, |1>|X>, |1>|Y> }`),
we can still demonstrate interference on it (e.g., by noting that it
is never measured as `|0>|X> - |1>|Y>`).

[6] Leaving aside the fact that in practice, information travels up
from my toe and probably reaches "me" very rapidly.

[7] If they are exposed to the environment, then lots of stray particles
will become involved. Then it becomes impossible to exhibit interference
on the `E`-`D` pair for the same reason it is impossible to exhibit
interference on `E` alone after it encounters `D`. This is known as
*decoherence*.

Yet it is still
theoretically possible to exhibit interference on the `E`-`D`-`trillions
of stray particles` system, if only we were extremely technologically
advanced. We will encounter decoherence again later.

[8] Though the mind tries to avoid it anyway. Examples:

* "Maybe there *was* an answer before,
but we can't prove it." If we can demonstrate that there was one answer,
this would contradict standard QM. If we can't, then it's nothing more
than a coping mechanism.

* "There were two answers before, and there are still two. Nothing
weird about that." Wrong. Really embody the perspective of "one copy"
and try again. In "your world" (i.e., the thing you call "the world"),
there really was no answer, and now there really is -- assuming, again,
that you're comfortable with saying that a decaying cat is "really"
dead.

This is a manifestation of it being "deeply uncomfortable." On the
other hand, it really *could* be that QM is wrong. But I wouldn't bet
on it.
