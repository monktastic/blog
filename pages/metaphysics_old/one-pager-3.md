### Rationalist spirituality

Perhaps you've encountered ideas like
"[love is the purpose of existence](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html),"
and though maybe some tiny part of you wishes they were true, the more
logical parts of your mind acknowledge that they're nonsense or pure
fantasy.

I'd like to suggest that there is a sense in which they are *actually
true*, and that it's very worthwhile to see this.

I do not mean simply that they are good *metaphors* that you can employ
in the context of your existing worldview (though that has value too).
I mean that they are true in a way that *transcends* your normal
conceptual structures.

[Radical skepticism](radical-skepticism.html)

Based on evidence and logic alone, you have no reason to believe in
the existence of time. You cannot even say it is "likely" that
time exists, without making assumptions that themselves depend on time
being real. Nor can you even claim that it is "productive." Belief
in time is not *rational*, but *emotional*.

Look right now and try to take *dead seriously* the possibility
that you and the world popped into existence this very moment. Look at
your past and say "none of this *actually* happened." Remember that as
far as you can possibly know, it's not actually any less likely than the
alternative. Do this until you actually *see* it.

If you merely *understand* it, it will feel like "so what?" If you
genuinely *see* it, it will feel like a brief "holy sh*t."
Don't give up until you have the latter experience.

<!-- TODO use this -->
Life feels mundane precisely because of your death grip on a belief
that has no basis: that there's nothing particularly special about
this moment, since you had one just like it a moment ago (and a moment
before that, and...).

Even if you recognize this, you will find it hard to avoid a conclusion
like "oh, he's trying to get me to be mindful." In other words, you
will slip back into assuming that your worldview really is correct, and
that these are just tricks to help you live better.

This is *precisely* the trap that ensnares you. By stuffing everything
into your worldview, you prevent yourself from seeing what is beyond it.

[Quantum mechanics](quantum-short.html)

Nobody can quite agree on the correct formulation or interpretation of
QM, despite over a hundred years of trying. It's not even clear that
most physicists *want* to know the answer:

```
I suspect that a substantial majority of physicists who use quantum
mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright
hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.
```

Why? Well, let us see
what can happen if we follow the standard rules[0] faithfully all the
way to the end. I suspect you won't like it very much either.

In the Schrodinger's Cat experiment, the cat is still in a
superposition of dead and alive before you encounter it (either directly
or indirectly via other particles that have come into contact with the
apparatus). The cat's fate is not determined yet, and in theory
there is an experiment that would demonstrate this[1]. This should be
true for you *even if your friend has seen the cat*. All that does is
entangle her with the cat.

This may already seem a little strange, but let's see what happens when
*you* see the cat.

Once you encounter a decomposing cat, there clearly *is* a right
answer regarding the cat's fate. But there *wasn't* a moment ago. What
changed in that moment? It can't be just your
*knowledge* of the real answer, since there wasn't one. In some
sense, the *truth* of the cat's fate came into existence simultaneously
with your encountering it (directly or indirectly). Not just that, but
at that moment the cat *has been dead* for some time, even though *that
wasn't true a moment ago*[2].

Can you see how this would be hard to swallow? Why we would be
desperately hoping for some other explanation? Pretty much *any*
explanation is preferable to the possibility that reality (together with
matching history) comes into being when you, personally, encounter it.

Who knows, maybe some alternative theory will pan out, and this will
all be disproved. But, like in the
previous exercise, the point here is to see what happens when you
confront the above possibility very squarely: your world (and a history
consistent with it) pops into existence simultaneously with your
experience of it. In your world (i.e., the thing you normally just call
"the world"), nobody else can do this.

[0] In particular, the unitary evolution. The collapse postulate can
be seen as one attempt (among many) to avert the natural disaster that
awaits at the end of the track.

[1] This is normally done via an *interference experiment.* Our limited
technology doesn't permit us to demonstrate it at such a macroscopic
scale, but we've done it with at least tens of thousands of atoms, and
see no fundamental limit.

This practical difficulty is due to something called "decoherence," but
(as far as we know) this is only a practical limitation, not a
theoretical one. That said, a human-sized object is many orders of
magnitude beyond what is practical today.

There's also the possibility that something causes a "collapse", though
nobody knows how or why such a thing would happen,
nor is there any particularly good experimental evidence for it.

[2] Sometimes people try to argue that the "many worlds interpretation"
solves this, since there are *still* two answers once you see it (with
one copy of you in each "world" seeing one result). But this doesn't
make things any better: *each copy of you* experiences being the "sole
observer" of her world.

1. Logic (time is pure preference)
2. Empiricism (love and consciousness)

The world goes the way you intend.

How does this make you feel?

* It doesn't matter how I *feel* dammit, what matters is the real truth
out there.

Excellent. Now review why you have *no reason* to believe in such a
thing. How does that make you feel?

Your belief in time is based entirely on circular reasoning. As such,
it has **no** justification other than "it feels good." Yet, you feel
powerfully compelled to see it as Truth.

Why? What compels you to believe in space, time, and brains? Try to
answer without reference to those things.

[Layers of mind](layers-of-mind.html)

Deep layers of your mind (not your "brain," mind you) are responsible
for turning a belief in time into the *experience* of time, which is
taken as evidence for the belief. This powerful feedback loop explains
both the compulsion to believe and the repeated attempt to use circular
reasoning to justify it.

We discover that materialism is not *false*; it is true *because you
make it true*.

[Consciousness](consciousness.html)

Consciousness is the potential that manifests as beliefs, thoughts, and
the experiences that you lump together as "reality." Whether or not this
is true in an ultimate sense, it is a valuable insight to experience.
One comes to see more deeply the structure of belief and experience.

The knot of materiality loosens further.

[QM and the measurement problem](quantum.html)

We discover that the foundational question of quantum mechanics is
not so much "solved" as "swept under the rug" in modern treatments.
When reasoned carefully, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that *you*
are the sole observer in your universe.
