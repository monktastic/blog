### Summary

> *Most of us suspect we don’t really know what life is. But really **knowing** 
you don't know takes some work. It requires you to clearly see that your story 
is just a story; and to become conscious of the deep mystery at its foundation.*
>
> -- Tim Freke

The modern way of thinking assures us that reality is made of intrinsically
lifeless stuff being shuffled around by mindless laws. Even if a small voice
inside you wishes there were a meaningful sense in which life is genuinely
magical and the world truly alive, there seems to be no legitimate, rational way
to accommodate these beliefs. At best, it must be wishful thinking; errant
biochemistry aimed solely at propagating your selfish genes.

The confidence in this worldview is profoundly misplaced, but because its
fundamental error is rooted much more deeply than we normally have conscious
access to, the mistake is fiendishly hard to see. Various people through the
ages have tried to communicate it, but the frequently religious overtones are
commonly off-putting to modern readers. I have no reason to believe I can do
better, but I want to try.

The certainty is not only *undeserved*, but profoundly *disastrous*. The
converging planetary crises of our day are ultimately due to our inability to
accommodate the possibility of "real life." By seeing reality as fundamentally
dead, we have created a self-fulfilling prophecy that is slowly ensuring it
becomes so.

Ready? Let's launch right into it.

## Radical skepticism

"Radical skepticism" refers to a family of philosophies stating that *all*
knowledge is suspect. For example, as mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell
once pointed out:

> *There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.*

Suppose you see a picture from "yesterday." How can you be sure that it didn't
also spring into being five minutes ago, with the rest of the world? It *seems*
pretty darn unlikely, but we can't say it's impossible. Unfortunately, the
problem is even worse than that.

How do we know that it's "unlikely?" We know because the laws of physics just
don't work that way. But when did we observe these "laws of physics?" In the
"real" past? That's circular reasoning, so we can't trust it. Even Occam's Razor
runs into this problem, relying as it does on past examples for support. In
fact, *all* arguments end up being circular in one subtle way or another, and
are thus invalid. As a result, we cannot meaningfully evaluate how "likely" it
is that the past is real, and we cannot say that a fake past is "unlikely."

There are many such skeptical hypotheses. Here's another: we have
[no reason to believe that the laws of physics will continue to operate five
minutes from now](/blog/pages/dream/future.html). A third is that you cannot
know whether a physical world really exists, or if this is all a dream of sorts.
You may argue that you're not clever enough to dream up such a complicated
world, but "you" don't have to be -- only the *real* you outside the dream does,
and who knows what *her* reality is like?

We cannot rationally conclude that any of these possibilities are "unlikely,"
despite the overwhelming urge to do so. What we *can* try to do, however, is say
that they are pointless. Life clearly goes much more smoothly if you assume that
things are as they seem, whether you have purely rational justification or not.
Russell himself recognized this:

> *Skepticism, while logically impeccable, is psychologically impossible, and
there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any philosophy which pretends to
accept it.*

As did David Hume:

> *Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument which I
have been to such pains to inculcate, whether I be really one of those skeptics
who hold that everything is uncertain, I should reply that neither I nor any
other person was ever sincerely and constantly of that opinion. I dine, I play
backgammon, I converse and am merry with my friends and when after three or four
hours of amusement I would return to these speculations, they appear so cold and
strange and ridiculous that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any
further. Thus the skeptic still continues to reason and believe, though he
asserts he cannot defend his reason by reason.*

But these great thinkers were missing something crucial: *understanding*
skeptical arguments -- no matter how well -- is not enough. If it were, many
bright grade schoolers would already be enlightened. Your metaphysical beliefs
are not so capricious that mere *thinking* can dislodge them. To discover what
actually lies beneath, we must go deeper....

## Meditation

Have you ever had the experience of reading a book, only to discover minutes
later that your eyes have been scanning the page while your mind was elsewhere?
If interrupted and asked what you were thinking about, you could probably
answer. So your thinking wasn't unconscious -- and yet you weren't aware of it.
In a similar way, your mind is constantly doing a lot of stuff,
semi-consciously, without you suspecting it. Yet, without serious practice, this
is almost impossible to discover.

Author Sam Harris:

> [B]eginning meditators often think that they are able to concentrate on a
single object, such as the breath, for minutes at a time, only to report after
days or weeks of intensive practice that their attention is now carried away by
thought every few seconds. This is actually progress. It takes a certain degree
of concentration to even notice how distracted you are.

As a young adult, I spent three months meditating full time in a Tibetan
Buddhist center, and what Harris describes kept unfolding in increasingly subtle
ways. At first, my mind was filled with an endless stream of coarse thoughts:
what I was going to eat for dinner, what time it was, etc. As I began to notice
those, I patted myself on the back, only to discover underneath them a more
subtle stream of narration. As those settled, even more faint ideation became
apparent. It is like waves on the ocean: the tiny fluctuations only become
visible as the large ones subside -- but they're always there.

The fact is, your mind is doing a *whole lot* of conceptualizing, most of it
beneath your normal conscious threshold. Becoming aware of the intermediate
layers brings great practical benefit. For example, you can discover yourself
becoming "hangry" long before it manifests and harms others. You may even
realize that *all* of your jerkiness stems from unresolved suffering, and never
from an authentic desire to harm. Then maybe you begin to suspect that nearly
*all* harmful behavior works this way (even when it's not obvious) and that
only through relentless compassion can we help ourselves and each other uproot
the darkness we so tragically proliferate.

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle*
> -- Philo of Alexandria

> *Forgive them father, for they know not what they do.*
> -- Jesus of Nazareth

The subtlest layers are even more profound.

At all times, you are continually reinforcing your assumptions about the nature
of reality. While this is happening, it is indeed "psychologically impossible"
(as Russell said) to genuinely consider that they may be *dead wrong*. You will
convince yourself in a million clever ways that *obviously* they're true,
philosophical sophistry be damned. And in any case, you *must* believe them, or
else you'll go crazy. But it isn't true. It is possible to function *as though*
reality operates in the standard way, without taking it literally. And something
surprising happens when you do.

When you finally cut through this thicket of unfounded assumptions, you may have
an experience that can genuinely be called "transcendent" -- in that it
transcends all of your notions of reality. And in addition to seeing what you
*don't* (and cannot) know, you also finally come into contact with the one thing
you *do* know -- and in a strange and delightful sense, have *always* known,
somehow without realizing it.

## The Light

> *So close you can't see it*
>
> *So deep you can't fathom it*
>
> *So simple you can't believe it*
>
> *So good you can't accept it*
>
> -- Tibetan Buddhist saying

As you can imagine, this will be hard to communicate, but let's try.

Close your eyes and listen to a sound. Now see if you can recognize the sheer
experience of sound as being "made of" the light of your mind. The defining
characteristic of the mind is its capacity to experience. That potentiality
manifests in the *form of* particular experiences (such as sound). In this
sense, it is not that your mind is merely *experiencing* a sound; its intrinsic
luminosity is manifesting *as* the experience you call "sound" or "hearing."
To say it again: that sound *is* your mind; it is not merely being heard *by*
your mind.

If that is hard to understand, we can lean on the physicalist paradigm for a
moment. Think of it like this: when certain neurons fire, you experience a
sound. The experience of sound is nothing *but* those neurons firing. Even if
the same bird chirped, air molecules vibrated, your ears transduced the signal,
etc., if those neurons weren't firing, there would be no chirp-experience.
Conversely, even if there were no actual bird (like in a dream), those neurons
firing would still be experienced as the sound of chirping. That sound *is* your
brain. Now forgetting the physicalist assumption, that sound is your *mind*
-- your sheer capacity for experience -- shining out in all its glory.

The mind shines in the form of your other sense fields, too, as well as in the
form of thoughts, emotions, memories, etc. (which together are sometimes,
confusingly, *also* defined as "the mind"). Everything you've ever experienced
as "the world" has been your mind, illuminated. Even if you cannot know anything
about the true *cause* of this luminosity, the one thing you *can* know is that 
whatever it is, it *is* shining right now.

If this fact feels dull or obvious, it is because part of your mind is still
dead certain that it can *explain* this luminosity via your (obviously true)
metaphysical beliefs: it's caused by a world out there, a brain in here, etc.
When you experience the luminosity completely nakedly -- finally free of your
unfounded assumptions about its cause and nature -- something remarkable can
happen. You may experience joy, wonder, awe, gratitude, humility, and love
beyond your wildest imagination; seemingly beyond what ought to be possible. You
rediscover the unspeakable and mind-shattering miracle of *existence*. Not
necessarily "your" existence or "the world's" existence, but
*existence itself,* devoid of all the normal trappings that make it seem
mundane.

> mundane /ˌmənˈdān/ (adj.):
>
> 1. Worldly, earthly, profane, vulgar as opposed to heavenly.
> 2. **Pertaining to ... physical reality ....**
> 3. Ordinary; not new.
> 4. **Tedious; repetitive and boring.**

But the rational mind cannot stand not knowing, and will try to reassert its
dominance. If you somehow manage to resist its cunning traps, the mystery vista
opens out further.

## What lies beyond

This next part is the hardest to write. I'm not quite sure how to put it into
words, so I'll use an analogy.

Imagine being in a nighttime dream. Your dream character's name is Character,
and your waking self is named Dreamer. Character doesn't share any of Dreamer's
traits or memories. In fact, suppose you (as Character) have no concept of
Dreamer at all.

One day you are stunned by a gorgeous red flower and are driven to ask: what
causes me to see this brilliant hue? Using the scientific method, you discover
that the Sun is emitting photons, which reflect off flavonoids in the flower,
get transduced by opsins in your retina, turn into electrical impulses that
travel to your visual cortex, and voilà! You now have a complete description of
how you see a red flower.

Then one day you become
*[lucid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream)* in your dream. You discover,
beyond any doubt, that the entire dream is made of your mind. But it's not
*Character's* mind; it is *Dreamer's* mind, which transcends the dream itself.
The experience of "brilliant red" is not produced by any phenomenon *inside* the 
dream, and certainly not by anything inside Character's (imaginary) skull. It is 
simply Dreamer's mind, illuminated -- just like everything else that Character
has been seeing, smelling, tasting, hearing, touching, and thinking. 

You see that the whole dream is made of a luminosity that is obviously not
caused by anything *within* the dream -- no matter how cunning the evidence to
the contrary. It is, in this sense, miraculous. Not only that, but you, the
other characters, and the rest of the dream are all profoundly one -- in a way
that makes no apparent logical sense, but that part of you somehow always knew.

What is it that allows you to know all this? It is not merely another piece of
information you consider and accept in your dream narrative. I've had thousands
of lucid dreams, and yet it is quite common that I think "this is a dream" and
even *believe* it, without ever becoming lucid. Lucidity isn't mere information;
it is more like a *phase change*. You *wake up* -- or, maybe more accurately,
the dream wakes up to itself. This awakening can deepen to the point where it
rediscovers precisely *how* it weaves itself together out of sheer imagination,
in a sort of cosmic interpretive dance.

I will not try to convince you that any of this is true of your present
situation -- that life is genuinely magical; that life's purpose is to wake up
to this fact; that love is somehow foundational to it all; that birth may not
have been the start, and death may not be the end. There would be no point.
But I *will* encourage you to get on a path that lets you genuinely reconsider
your metaphysical beliefs. Doing so may have profound implications for the
trajectory of this dream.

## The fate of humanity

The modern Western worldview does not allow consciousness or life to be anything
more than illusions; mere labels we attach to sufficiently complex biochemical
soups. We "know" that what *really* exists is inert matter pushed around by
mindless physical law. It is only *within* this framework that we permit 
ourselves to interpret statements like "life is wondrous, precious, and
miraculous." Deep down, we trust that these beliefs are merely mechanical
rearrangements of neurotransmitters, driven by the evolutionary process only to
help us spread our selfish genes.

It is *this* constellation of unjustified beliefs -- and moreover, our cocksure
certainty that they circumscribe all of reality -- that is at the heart of our
current planetary crisis.

The ecological collapse, climate catastrophe, biodiversity crisis, anxiety and
depression epidemics, etc., are all rooted in our deep conviction that reality
is fundamentally mundane and lifeless. We fail to see the genuine magic all
around us, and then try to fill that gaping void with an endless parade of
trinkets and gadgets -- the accumulation of which, ironically, is destroying 
this reality's very embodiment of life: what we call "nature."

We will not be able to simply engineer our way out of this mess while preserving
the underlying mindset that inevitably generates it. The problem is so much
deeper than that. By seeing reality as fundamentally dead, we are making it so.
 
Even as I wrote these paragraphs, I can feel the heavy judgment of modern
scientific reductionism weighing down on me. "Come on, are you trying to
convince people that there's some spooky invisible force? Can't you see that
that's just your superstitious monkey brain rebelling against the cold, hard,
irrefutable facts of reality, unable to cope?"

Against such a claim, I am powerless. All I can do is urge you to reconsider
your unassailable yet misguided assurance regarding the most basic "facts"
about the world. If the very nature of reality is *far stranger* than you have
been led to believe, you won't discover it through any of the obvious routes.
You must move *perpendicularly* to the dream itself, in a sense.

Guys like Elon Musk are said to be testing the hypothesis that reality is a
simulation, but they're looking in the wrong direction. The dreamer is
looking out your eyes, even as you read this. You must turn the light of
awareness back upon itself, until it rediscovers its own primordial *aliveness.*

> *So close you can't see it*.

The world *is* alive. Life *is* magical. Let's rediscover the profound meaning
of these words before it's too late.
