> *Most of us suspect we don’t really know what life is. But really **knowing** 
you don't know takes some work. It requires you to clearly see that your story 
is just a story; and to become conscious of the deep mystery at its foundation.*
>
> -- Tim Freke

The modern way of thinking assures us that there is no such thing as magic or
miracles. The world is made of fundamentally lifeless stuff being randomly
shuffled around by mindless laws. Even if a small voice inside you *wants* there
to be something more to it all, your appreciation for science (and your wish
to fit into modern society) compel you to interpret this desire as a naïve
distraction from the "cold, hard facts" of reality.

This is a tragic mistake of epic proportions whose consequences you see
unfolding around you today. In a meaningful sense, *all* of reality is
miraculous, and we *are* all one. Understanding this sense takes considerable
effort and honesty, but it pays off handsomely. Figures throughout history have
tried to communicate it, to apparently little avail. I have no reason to believe
I can do better, but I might as well try.

## Radical skepticism

"Radical skepticism" refers to a family of philosophies stating that *all*
knowledge is suspect. For example, as mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell
once pointed out:

> *There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.*

Suppose you see a picture from "yesterday." How can you know that it didn't
*also* spring into being five minutes ago? It *seems* pretty darn unlikely, but
we can't say it's impossible. Unfortunately, the problem is even worse than 
that.

How do we know that it's *unlikely*? We know because the laws of physics just
don't work that way. But when did we observe these "laws of physics?" In the
"real" past? That's circular reasoning, so we can't trust it. Even Occam's Razor
runs into this problem, relying as it does on past examples for support. In
fact, *all* arguments end up being circular in one subtle way or another, and
are thus invalid. As a result, we cannot meaningfully evaluate how "likely" it
is that the past is real, and we cannot say that a fake past is "unlikely."

This is far from being the only skeptical hypothesis. Here's another: we have
[no reason to believe that the laws of physics will continue to hold five
minutes from now](/dream/future.html). A third is that you cannot know whether
the physical world around you really exists, or if it is all a dream. Any
argument you try to make against it ("but then I ought to be able to fly!") is
easily countered if you're honest ("you're just not
[lucid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream) yet").

So we cannot rationally say that any of these possibilities are "unlikely." What
we *can* do, however, is say that they are pointless. Life clearly goes much 
more smoothly if you assume that things are as they seem, whether you have 
purely rational justification or not. Russell himself recognized this:

> *Skepticism, while logically impeccable, is psychologically impossible, and
there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any philosophy which pretends to
accept it.*

As did David Hume:

> *Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument which
I have been to such pains to inculcate, whether I be really one of those
skeptics who hold that everything is uncertain, I should reply that
neither I nor any other person was ever sincerely and constantly of
that opinion. I dine, I play backgammon, I converse and am merry with
my friends and when after three or four hours of amusement I would return
to these speculations, they appear so cold and strange and ridiculous
that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any further. Thus the
skeptic still continues to reason and believe, though he asserts he
cannot defend his reason by reason.*

But these great thinkers were missing something crucial. If you merely try and
*believe* that the past is an illusion, a powerful defense mechanism deep in
your mind will prevent you from making much progress. To actually experience
what life is like free of your rigid certainties about reality, and thereby
determine the *true* value of radical skepticism, we must go deeper.

## Meditation

In breathing meditation, you allow your mind to rest on the sensations of the
breath, and gently guide it back when you notice that you are distracted. From
the outside, this looks like purely a method to train attention, but it is much
more than that. Author Sam Harris says:

> [B]eginning meditators often think that they are able to concentrate on a
single object, such as the breath, for minutes at a time, only to report after
days or weeks of intensive practice that their attention is now carried away by
thought every few seconds. This is actually progress. It takes a certain degree
of concentration to even notice how distracted you are.

As a young adult, I spent three months meditating full time in a Tibetan
Buddhist center, and what Harris describes kept unfolding. At first, my mind was
filled with an endless stream of coarse thoughts: what I was going to eat for
dinner, what time it was, etc. When I began to notice those, I patted myself on
the back, only to discover underneath them a more subtle stream of narration. As
those settled, even more faint ideation became apparent. It is like waves on
the ocean: the tiny fluctuations only become visible as the large ones subside
-- but they're always there.

The fact is, your mind is doing a *whole lot* of conceptualizing, most of it
beneath your normal conscious threshold. Becoming aware of the intermediate
layers brings great practical benefit. For example, you can discover yourself
becoming "hangry" long before it manifests and harms others. You may even
realize that *all* of your jerkiness stems from thoughts that you wouldn't
approve of -- if only they were exposed to the full light of awareness. Then 
maybe you begin to sense that this is true of *everyone*, and that only through 
relentless compassion and non-judgment can we help ourselves and others
transmute the darkness.

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle*
> -- Philo of Alexandria

The subtlest layers are even more profound.

At all times, you are continually reinforcing your assumptions about the nature
of reality. While this is happening, it is indeed "psychologically impossible"
to genuinely consider that they may be *dead wrong* -- just as Russell said. You
will convince yourself in a million ways that you *need* to take your beliefs
100% literally in order to function. But it isn't true. It is possible to
function *as though* reality operates in the standard way, without taking it
literally. And something surprising happens when you do.

When you finally cut through this thicket of unfounded assumptions about the
nature of reality, you may have an experience that can genuinely be called
"transcendent" -- in that it transcends every notion of reality you currently
hold. In addition to seeing what you *don't* (and cannot) know, you also finally
come into contact with what you *do* know -- and in a strange and delightful
sense, always *have* known, somehow without realizing it.

## The Light

> *So close you can't see it*
>
> *So deep you can't fathom it*
>
> *So simple you can't believe it*
>
> *So good you can't accept it*
>
> -- Tibetan Buddhist saying

As you can imagine, this will be hard to communicate, but let's try.

Close your eyes and listen to a sound. Now see if you can recognize the sheer
experience of sound as being "made of" your own mind, illuminated. The defining
characteristic of the mind is its capacity to experience. That potentiality
manifests in the *form of* particular experiences (such as sound). In this
sense, it is not that your mind is merely *experiencing* a sound; its intrinsic
luminosity is manifesting *as* the experience you call "sound" or "hearing."
To say it again: that sound *is* your mind; it is not merely being heard *by*
your mind.

If that is hard to understand, we can lean on the physicalist paradigm for a
moment. Think of it like this: when certain neurons fire, you experience a
sound. The experience of sound is nothing *but* those neurons firing. Even if
the same bird chirped, air molecules vibrated, your ears transduced the signal,
etc., if those neurons weren't firing, there would be no chirp-experience.
Conversely, even if there were no actual bird (like in a dream), those neurons
firing would still be experienced as the sound of chirping. That sound *is* your
brain. Now forgetting the physicalist description, that sound is your *mind*
-- your sheer capacity for experience -- shining out in all its glory.

The mind glows in the form of your other sense fields, too, as well as in the
form of thoughts, emotions, memories, etc. (which together are sometimes,
confusingly, *also* defined as "the mind"). Everything you've ever experienced
as "the world" has been your mind, illuminated. Even if you cannot know anything
about the true *cause* of this luminosity, the one thing you *can* know is that 
whatever it is, it *is* shining right now.

This fact may seem obvious, but it is normally heavily obscured by your constant
mental chatter. When you experience the luminosity completely nakedly --
finally free of your assumptions about its cause and nature -- something
remarkable can happen. You may experience joy, wonder, awe, gratitude, and love
beyond your wildest imagination; beyond what can normally fit inside the
confines of your mind. You rediscover the unspeakable magic of life.

At this point, the temptation is *very strong* to reorient yourself using the
safety blanket you've become so familiar with: "oh, never mind; I can explain
this all in terms of my brain and an external world." If you somehow manage to
resist this most cunning trap, the mystery deepens further.

## What lies beyond

This next part is the hardest to write. I'm not quite sure how to put it into
words, so I'll use an analogy.

Imagine being in a nighttime dream. Your dream character's name is Character,
and your waking self is named Dreamer. Character doesn't share any of Dreamer's
traits or memories. In fact, suppose you (as Character) have no concept of
Dreamer at all.

One day you are stunned by a gorgeous red flower and are driven to ask: what
causes me to see this brilliant hue? Using the scientific method, you discover
that the Sun is emitting photons, which reflect off flavonoids in the flower,
get transduced by opsins in your retina, turn into electrical impulses that
travel to your visual cortex, and voilà! You now have a complete description of
how you see a red flower.

Then one day you become
*[lucid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream)* in your dream. You discover,
beyond any doubt, that the entire dream is made of your mind. But it's not
*Character's* mind; it is *Dreamer's* mind, which transcends the dream itself.
The experience of "brilliant red" is not produced by any phenomenon *inside* the 
dream, and certainly not by anything inside Character's (imaginary) skull. It is 
simply Dreamer's mind, illuminated -- just like everything else that Character
has been seeing, smelling, tasting, hearing, touching, and thinking. 

The whole dream is made of a luminosity that is not caused by anything *within*
the dream -- despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. It is, in this
sense, miraculous. Not only that, but you, the other characters, and the rest of
the dream are all one.

When you lose lucidity (as generally happens) and return to being Character, all
the knowledge you gained while lucid becomes suspect. You rationalize that
there's no way to *know* that it's a dream and that you're all one. It was
probably just a trick of the goop inside your skull. In fact, the dream may even
evolve in a way that lets you "prove" that. You're left with vague platitudes
like "life is a miracle" -- which some lucky lass at Hallmark can put on
greeting cards that will grace the shelves of Walmart.

I'm not going to tell you that this reality is a dream in the mind of a
transcendent power. Or that the purpose of the dream is to wake up to this fact,
by recognizing your unity with and love for all beings. Or that every moment is
a miracle beyond your wildest imagination, and that you *really* ought to
realize this before your character dissolves back into the transcendent ground.
All of that would be too cliché, I have no evidence to give you, and it would 
cause you to expect far too much of me.

But I very strongly *will* advise you to have the experience yourself, so that
you can decide for yourself what it means.

## The fate of humanity

The modern Western worldview does not allow consciousness or life to be anything
more than illusions; mere labels we attach to sufficiently complex biochemical
soups. We "know" that what *really* exists is inert matter and mindless physical
law. The whole place is a glorified heap of interchangeable stuff, randomly
banging around for no particular reason. It is only *within* this framework that
we permit ourselves to interpret statements like "life is wondrous, precious,
and miraculous." Deep down, we know that even these ideas are merely mechanical
rearrangements of neurotransmitters, driven by the evolutionary process only to
help us spread our selfish genes.

It is *this* constellation of unjustified beliefs that is causing our current
planetary crisis.

The ecological collapse, climate catastrophe, biodiversity crisis, anxiety and
depression epidemics, etc., are all rooted in our deep conviction that reality
is fundamentally lifeless. As long as that belief is in place, we can do no
better than *make* this place lifeless. I cannot prove it, but until we learn to
see ourselves, each other, and nature as intrinsically *alive* -- in a sense
that transcends our modern, impoverished notion of the word -- we will continue
to destroy it all. We will not be able to cleverly engineer our way out of this
mess while preserving the underlying mindset that inevitably generates it.
 
Even as I wrote these paragraphs, I can feel the judgment of modern scientific
reductionism weighing down on me. "Come on, are you really trying to convince
people that there's some spooky invisible force involved? Can't you see that
that's just your superstitious monkey brain rebelling against the cold, hard,
irrefutable facts of reality, unable to cope?"

Against such a claim, I am powerless. All I can do is urge you to reconsider
your unassailable yet misguided assurance regarding the most basic "facts" about
the world, as laid out above. If the very nature of reality is *far stranger*
than you have been led to believe, you won't discover that through any of the
obvious routes. Guys like Elon Musk are said to be testing the hypothesis that
reality is a simulation, but they're looking in the wrong direction. The dreamer
is looking out your eyes, even as you read this. *So close you can't see it*.

The world is alive. Life is magical. Let's rediscover the profound meaning of
these words before it's too late.
