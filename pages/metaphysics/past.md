### Summary

There is no (logical) reason to believe in the past.

Mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell:

> *There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.*

Forget "five minutes ago"; there's no way to know that it didn't all just
spring into being *now*. How can you decide whether the past is real or not?
When you try, your mind might try out various avenues.

* My memory tells me otherwise.

Your memory popped into being now.

* This picture proves otherwise.

That picture was just created now.

* I've been reading this document for at least 30 seconds.

No you haven't; it all popped into being... *now*.

* The laws of physics say it's impossible.

The laws that were proven in the past and that you learned in the past? 
That's circular reasoning.

* Occam's Razor suggests that the simplest solution is best, and a real
past is simpler.

Try justifying Occam's Razor without reference to the past. You only trust
Occam's Razor because it has worked before. Circular.

* Mathematically speaking, there are many more possibilities in which time
is real, so overall it is more likely that time is real.

* A theory's predictive power is a good test of its truth. A real past gives
more predictive power, so that's evidence of its correctness.

* ...

Again, try to justify these assertions. You will either find yourself starting
with axioms that presuppose time, or else making logical steps that assume 
it in some way or another. You may not even notice yourself doing this, since
you assume it so instinctively and implicitly.

Long story short: there is no justification that is not circular. Thus
there is no justification at all, other than "it's more convenient to
believe in the past." It is not logically justified to conclude that 
a real past is "more likely" to be true.

Truth be told, even the claim of convenience is circular: if *this* is the
first moment, then how can you be sure that your "past" belief in time is
helping you now? But no point pouring salt on a fresh wound.

Even Russell concluded:

> *Skepticism, while **logically impeccable**, is **psychologically
impossible**, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any
philosophy which pretends to accept it.*

In other words, there may not be any logical reason to believe in a past,
but we can't really help it, so let's just smile and nod and go along with it.

Physicist Sean Carroll:

> *There is **no way** to distinguish between the scenarios by
collecting new data.*
>
> *What we’re left with is our choice of prior credences. We’re allowed
to pick priors however we want—and every possibility should get some
nonzero number. But it’s okay to set our prior credence in radically
skeptical scenarios at very low values, and attach higher prior credence
to the straightforwardly realistic possibilities.*
>
> *Radical skepticism is less useful to us; it gives us no way to go
through life. All of our purported knowledge, and all of our goals and
aspirations, might very well be tricks being played on us. But what
then? We cannot actually act on such a belief, since any act we might
think is reasonable would have been suggested to us by that annoying
demon. Whereas, if we take the world roughly at face value, we have a
way of moving forward. There are things we want to do, questions we
want to answer, and strategies for making them happen. *We have every
right to give high credence to views of the world that are productive
and fruitful, in preference to those that would leave us paralyzed
with ennui.**
