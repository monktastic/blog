Now let us briefly explore another question we raised earlier:

* Whether or not there is an external reality, how much leeway do I have in 
constructing my private reality? I clearly have some freedom to interpret, 
but how deep does this freedom go?

Have you ever had the experience of being temporarily free of your
mental baggage? Where you felt unburdened by your past, and as a result,
much more joyful and unconstrained regarding your future?

If you don't feel that way right now, what is stopping you? Isn't it
because you already have some idea of how the future will go, based on
how the past has gone, and the predicted trajectory isn't as beautiful as
you'd like?

If you've followed the series this far, you will be unsurprised to discover 
that this way of thinking is completely illogical. Not only is there no 
reason to trust the past, but:

[*There is no logical reason to believe that the "laws of nature" will
continue to operate in the future.*](future.html)

This will no doubt strike you as absurd. Nonetheless, if you follow
the reasoning very carefully, the conclusion is again inevitable.
Philosophers continue to debate the meaning and consequences of this
conclusion, but it is well-accepted. If you think "well believing it has
worked so far, so I should continue to believe it," you have fallen directly
into the jaws of the trap.

You probably think "well maybe we can't find a reason to *believe* that it is
true, but it obviously *is* true, so this is just a lot of empty
philosophizing." But again, if you very honestly try to reconcile *why* you are 
so supremely confident that something is "obvious" when you have *no logical 
justification for it*, you'll find at the core a deep emotional knot. This is
again the fear of going crazy, or of your world falling apart.

The alternative on offer here is that the seeming consistency of the *world* is 
actually nothing more than the need for consistency deep in the *mind*, but 
projected "outwards." Your certainty about the future isn't the *result* of 
some actual consistency, but ultimately, the *cause* of it. 

You will not see this clearly until you are a fully awakened Buddha, but there 
may be some baby steps you can take in the mean time.

We're acquainted with the idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you "know"
that somebody is a jerk, then you'll treat them as though they are one, and
they're likely to respond in ways that further cement your "knowledge." Then 
you'll likely overlook the part you played in the process, and instead feel 
proud about being a good judge of character. Similarly, if you "just know" 
that a job interview will go well, your enthusiasm is likely to be infectious 
and help you win the position.

There's nothing very strange about this. It's easily explainable within your
current mental framework. Your thoughts affect your behavior, which is visible
to other people -- even if only on a subconscious level -- and enters their
brain via photons, sound waves, etc. You're very likely not *thinking* about
these mechanisms of interaction on a conscious level, but your entire way of
relating to the world assumes them. If you're in a waiting room trying to calm
your thoughts, it's probably because you don't want it to reflect in your
behavior, and not because you actually believe that people can read thoughts.

Of course, people probably *cannot* read thoughts, and so this is an eminently
reasonable way to think. Trying to reconcile mind-reading with materialism is
like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. A deep layer of your mind is
generating one metaphysics, while a higher layer is trying to believe another. 
This cannot lead to sanity.

On the other hand, what if you were to gently *release* all of your certainties
about how the world "must" operate? You don't have to replace them with weird
beliefs, either. Instead, monitor your mind carefully for assumptions, and hold
them a little more lightly. 

This will be especially hard for certain things that you *just know* to be true, 
and that you have a lot of evidence for. "My partner is like such-and-such,
so this interaction can only go like so-and-so." These rigid structures are
extremely tough to confront, but ultimately, dissolving them is where the most
healing is available. You may already sense at some level that this is what
your relationships are ultimately about.

The general idea can be called "radical forgiveness." It's radical for two
reasons. First, it will take every ounce of *humility* you have to be willing to
question things that you are confident you can "prove," and second, it will
require all your *courage* to forgive deeply enough that the underlying trauma
is actually healed.

Recall that the fear of insanity is the result of an ossified ego.
Radical forgiveness is precisely the kind of practice that would
simultaneously weaken your egoic grip *and* potentially
generate the kind of evidence you'd need to confirm that things are far
stranger than you currently allow this dream to demonstrate.

It's a two-for-one deal, and luckily, supplies last until you're
[totally awake](www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html).

For some reason, nobody finds it too strange that much of Tibetan
Buddhism comes not from the historical Buddha, but from the
[primordial Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi-Buddha) via
various people's dreams. It might be because we can sense something
profoundly true regardless of provenance.

If there were a modern teaching that came via Dream Jesus, you'd no
doubt find it too laughable to bother reading. So I won't bother
to tell you where this quote is from. Note that the word "thinking"
below does not refer to the coarse conceptualization you normally notice, 
but to the subtle layers of cognition referred to 
[earlier](layers-of-mind.html).

> *The Course's assertion is that everything stems from the mind. The mind's thinking provides the basis for everything that it experiences. Whichever way the mind chooses to look at reality, it will find itself surrounded by and experiencing a "reality" that is the precise mirror of that. The mind's fundamental belief-system first manifests as inner feelings, emotions, interpretations and perceptions; and then manifests as the "outer" reality in which the mind seems to live.*
>

>
> *Our healing, then, must be a healing of the mind, a healing of our fundamental perspective on reality. This is what the miracle does. It comes in a moment, a holy instant, when we decide to temporarily suspend our habitual perspective on things. As we momentarily loosen our grip on the ego, our minds are allowed to shift into a new way of seeing things. And since our thinking is the foundation for our entire experience, as our thinking shifts, so does everything else. Our whole experience of life is allowed to brighten from the bottom up, making this kind of healing more deeply liberating than being healed of even the most insidious and destructive physical disease.*
