title: Idealism in a nutshell
description:
---

Perhaps you've heard ideas like
"[love is the purpose of existence](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html),"
and though maybe some tiny part of you wishes they were true, the more
logical parts of your mind acknowledge that they're nonsense or pure
fantasy. You're sophisticated, and understand that the universe is
really just a random collection of dead matter that has somehow
self-organized into bits that amuse themselves with romantic notions to
avoid the harsh truth.

If you actually *enjoy* this narrative, then by all means, carry on.

If you don't do it because you *like* it, but because you've become
convinced that it's the unavoidable Truth, then you might like to play
around with some of the ideas here.

[Radical skepticism](radical-skepticism.html)

Based on evidence and logic alone, you have no reason to believe in
the existence of time. You cannot even say it is "likely" that
time exists without making assumptions that can only be justified by
presupposing time. Belief in time is thus *pure preference*.

If you can consider this fact with total openness -- "the past may
genuinely be an illusion, and I cannot even say that this is '*unlikely*'"
-- then you may experience a brief "oh, sh*t" moment. This is a tiny
incision in your worldview. The self-healing mechanism will repair it
very rapidly, but not completely.

<!-- Why couldn't this all be a trick of the brain? -->


This does *not* entitle you to open the floodgates to all
manner of [woo-woo](http://skepdic.com/woowoo.html). Instead, it might
allow you to open up to the question: are there *other* models of
reality that are in accordance with observed data, and as logically
consistent as my current one? What happens if I adopt them?

1. Logic (time is pure preference)
2. Empiricism (love and consciousness)

The world goes the way you intend.

How does this make you feel?

* It doesn't matter how I *feel* dammit, what matters is the real truth
out there.

Excellent. Now review why you have *no reason* to believe in such a
thing. How does that make you feel?

Your belief in time is based entirely on circular reasoning. As such,
it has **no** justification other than "it feels good." Yet, you feel
powerfully compelled to see it as Truth.

Why? What compels you to believe in space, time, and brains? Try to
answer without reference to those things.

[Layers of mind](layers-of-mind.html)

Deep layers of your mind (not your "brain," mind you) are responsible
for turning a belief in time into the *experience* of time, which is
taken as evidence for the belief. This powerful feedback loop explains
both the compulsion to believe and the repeated attempt to use circular
reasoning to justify it.

We discover that materialism is not *false*; it is true *because you
make it true*.

[Consciousness](consciousness.html)

Consciousness is the potential that manifests as beliefs, thoughts, and
the experiences that you lump together as "reality." Whether or not this
is true in an ultimate sense, it is a valuable insight to experience.
One comes to see more deeply the structure of belief and experience.

The knot of materiality loosens further.

[QM and the measurement problem](quantum.html)

We discover that the foundational question of quantum mechanics is
not so much "solved" as "swept under the rug" in modern treatments.
When reasoned carefully, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that *you*
are the sole observer in your universe.
