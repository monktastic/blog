## Preface

There is a thorny problem in quantum physics known as the "measurement
problem." Because much of the math used in doing QM is genuinely hard,
the mathematically unsophisticated reader may be convinced that he or
she cannot understand the issue. But while an advanced-undergraduate
level of linear algebra *is* required to understand the details, only
careful reasoning is required to understand the central difficulty.

It is not thorny because of the math, but because the philosophical
implications may be deeply uncomfortable for physicists and laypeople
alike.
Caltech physicist [Sean Carroll](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/23/physicists-should-stop-saying-silly-things-about-philosophy/):
```
I suspect that a substantial majority of physicists who use quantum
mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright
hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.
```

Why are they hostile? Because it is common for laypeople to try and
use QM to support all manner of New Age hooey. While this is indeed
tragic, this author feels that a much greater tragedy is perpetrated
when the pendulum swings the other way, and the issue is swept under
the rug.

There's something genuinely head-scratching here that we don't want to
confront too directly.

This is from Edward Witten, a physicist so overpoweringly smart that
his fellow theoretical physicists casually throw around terms like
["smarter than anyone else"](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/magazine/a-theory-of-everything.html?pagewanted=all)
and "head and shoulders above the rest:"
```
I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected
with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that
has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum
mechanics and its applications to the universe.

Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make
sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the
observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely
uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash
with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics,
and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go
away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.
```

For this reason, I would like to present you with the case as clearly
as I can.

As this article is part of a series on metaphysical idealism, you
should be unsurprised by my own conclusion. Nonetheless, I advise you to
draw your own.

### Required background

As background, you must understand the famous two-slit experiment.
If you don't already know it, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc)
is a clip from the New Age movie "What The Bleep Do We Know?" While
it does a great job of communicating the experiment, we will also
briefly look at why its conclusions are bogus. Even worse, it misses
the *real* punchline.


## Modeling the world

This will require a bit of math, but I'm going to simplify the notation.
In the two-slit experiment, when the electron (`E`) encounters the
screen, it can go one of two ways (left or right). We normally
write this:

`|E_left> + |E_right>`

Let us take some liberties, replacing the symbols with words. "Or" is
not technically precise, but it will do for our present purposes:

`E left or E right`

At this point it is possible to detect the "or" by means of an
interference experiment. This is what causes the light and dark bands.

Now, if a detector (`D`) is placed at the slits, then the state becomes:

`(E left and D left) or (E right and D right)`

You don't see a component like `E left and D right` because that would
just indicate a faulty detector.

One side-effect is that we can no longer show interference using `E`
alone. In other words, we won't see an interference pattern once the
electron is detected. We *can* show it on the `E` and `D` joint system,
but as more particles get involved, this becomes harder in practice.

This is the point at which some people lose the plot. See, for example,
the [4:25 mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc) from
the clip in the intro:
```
The electron decided to act differently, as though it was aware that
it was being watched!
```
Sounds spooky, right? They even give the detector an eyeball with
creepy eyelashes. But it didn't "decide" anything and it wasn't "aware"
of anything -- unless you also think a pool ball is "aware" of the
cue ball hitting it and "decides" to move as a result. It's really
just straightforward physics and math[5], although some misunderstand
and think that detectors must be conscious.

The detector has in *one* sense "measured" the electron: in each
"branch" of that superposition, the detector is correctly displaying
the electron's path. On the other hand, *both branches still exist*.
We can confirm this (in principle) by doing the joint interference
experiment we referred to above. Here some misunderstand this as
suggesting that the "measurement problem" has been solved. That, too,
is wrong as we shall see.

<!-- TODO: Draw a parallel with the first- vs third-person conscious
definitions. -->

Anyway, as objects (such as the detector) interact with the experiment,
they become part of it. In particular, since *you* have not seen the
results yet, your state still lies outside of it.

When the electron hits the
screen (`S`), the screen registers it on the left or right:

`(E left and D left and S left) or (E right and D right and S right)`

And so on. *Every* physical object that encounters the system gets "split"
in two, joining the superposition. If this is so, then when does the
`or` disappear? When do we get **one** answer to which way the electron
"really" went, instead of two?

## The measurement problem

This is the heart of the so-called "measurement problem" in QM, and
there are a few attempts at answering it. I'll share two of the more
common.

#### Collapse

One possibility is that "something" causes the system to suddenly
and randomly collapse from two to one. The problem is, there doesn't
seem to be anything that could qualify as that "something," since all
physical systems (as far as we know) simply join the superposition.
Not only that, but going from two to one loses information, which goes
squarely against everything we know about physics[4]. It is a sort of
deus ex machina, and I think it lives on mostly
for practical reasons, sidestepping the philosophical issues.

##### Consciousness causes collapse?

In 1967 Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner famously proposed a thought
experiment suggesting that not only does collapse occur, but only
*conscious beings* cause it. Imagine that your friend encounters
the experiment before you do. The math suggests that she "splits" and
joins the superposition (like any other physical system):

 `(E left and D left and ... and Friend sees left) or (... right)`

Notice how `Friend` appears in both branches, just like everything else.
Wigner felt that this
"appears absurd because it implies that my friend was in a state of
suspended animation."[1] "Clearly" she must see one outcome or the
other! Therefore, she must have collapsed the state into one,
for example:

`E left and D left and ... and Friend sees left`

The "or" has disappeared. The idea that humans have the magical property
of being the only things in the universe that can cause "collapse" is
widely considered bogus, but as we shall soon see, Wigner's argument
was actually more nuanced than that.

#### Many worlds

Another popular answer, known as the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)
is that the two *never* become one. The world-eating superposition
grows *forever*. If that is the case, why do I see only one result?
Simple: *I don't!* Once I encounter the experiment, "one copy" of me
sees one result, and another copy sees the other result:

`(E and D and S and Me left) or (... right)`

In other words: there were two possibilities before you saw it, but
there are still two after you see it. Each copy of you *thinks* there's
only one, but that's only because they don't have the full picture. So
there's nothing to explain!

Problem neatly solved, right?

Not so fast. Consider how things look for "one copy of you."

*Before* you encounter the experiment, you are entitled only to say
"*either* the electron went left (and the world reflects that) *or*
it went right." It's not that one *actually*
happened and you don't know which; the theory predicts that both
possibilities still exist -- even if that's *really really hard* to
demonstrate in practice[3]. This is true even if your friend has already
seen it.

I want to drive this point home: standard QM theory predicts, and MWI
does not deny,
that before you encounter the experiment *it is **not** valid to say
that "one result has **really** taken place but I don't know which*"
-- other than as a (very useful) practical approximation. Both
possibilities really remain.

*After* you see it, yes, there *is* a well-defined sense in which there
are still two possibilities. The question you must answer for yourself
is: is there *any meaningful sense* in which there is now only one? In
other words, when confronted with a
[decomposing cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat),
are you entitled to say "yes, this cat is *really* dead?"

If so, what exactly happened in the moment you saw it? What changed,
for you to be able to say "this cat is really dead" when a moment ago
you could not? The answer cannot be "my knowledge of the pre-existing
result," for as we took pains to point out, *there was no pre-existing
result.* "Maybe there was, but we just don't know about it" doesn't cut
it either, unless QM is wrong.

(And if not, then congratulations: I dub thee *quantum physicist*. Now
[shut up and calculate](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Shut_up_and_calculate).)

So MWI has not solved the problem; it has only gotten worse.
From the perspective of (one copy of) you, *something* happened when you
saw it, in a way that *didn't* happen when your friend did (despite it
being *very slippery* to make precise that "something"). In that case,
it is not "conscious beings" that are important, but *you in
particular*.


## The measurement problem, take two

Let's take a step back and re-examine the measurement problem. It asks,
basically, "why do we see only one outcome, when the math predicts two?"
But it's not really "we"; it's "me." I am really asking, "why do *I*
experience just one world?"

The measurement problem is a question about my *experience* of the
world. It should come as no surprise that any answer to it will be
closely connected to the question of experience, i.e., consciousness.

We saw that something happens when "I encounter" the system,
but notice what happens when we try to pin that down. What if my *toe*
encounters the experiment? No reason "I" can't treat it like any other
physical system and preserve the two branches[6]. The change happens
when the experiment encounters... "I."

So where *exactly* do we find this I?

This is just the question of consciousness in drag. But not just *any*
consciousness; *my* consciousness. We see that Wigner already understood
this well[2]:

```
This takes place whenever the result of an observation enters the
consciousness of the observer - or, to be even more painfully precise,
my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people
being only subjects of my observations.
```

Not that he particularly endorsed this conclusion:
```
However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
people, in their hearts, will go along with it.
```

But to avoid the conclusion of being the only observer (something akin
to solipsism), he had to inject other acrobatics -- ones that we can,
in principle, falsify. MWI does a better job of hiding this sleight of
hand, but ultimately falls, too.

If you carefully avoid sweeping things under the rug, and follow the
empirical and theoretical results closely, it is hard to avoid this
conclusion: *your* encountering the world is, in some sense,
*the* point at which many possibilities become one.

And it's not just about the occasional electron in a lab somewhere.
*Everything* around you is continually evolving in many directions at
once.

## You and consciousness

Okay, so consciousness is not a property that other people have. But
actually, it is not even a property that *you* have.

Instead, as we saw [here](consciousness.html), consciousness usefully be
thought of as the very *fabric* from which your reality is made. In
its present configuration, it is manifesting "your perspective." This
is an experiential realization that doesn't rely on or support QM, but
meshes with it quite naturally.

Looked at in this way, it should come as no surprise that this is where
the rubber meets the road: it is precisely where the world is made
"real."

This may shed some light on why such brilliant thinkers as Ed Witten
do not believe that consciousness will become part of physics (or
biology or neuroscience...). Physics is about *things*, and *things*
rigidly obey the laws of QM. "Consciousness" does not refer to a
*thing* in this sense, but the remarkable fact that this theoretical
sea of things somehow becomes *real*.

As much as we try to deny it, it seems Wigner had it right all along:
```
it will remain remarkable, in whatever way our future concepts may
develop, that the very study of the external world led to the conclusion
that the content of the consciousness is an ultimate reality.
```

[3] Sometimes "[decoherence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/)"
is raised as an objection. Put simply it says:
```
Once the experiment is exposed to the environment, there are untold
trillions of photons and air molecules interacting with it, and it is
practically impossible to track them all. The human body alone has
~10^28 particles! So it is in practice impossible to demonstrate the
superposition, and we should not call it one.
```

The astute reader will notice the weasel word "practically." Decoherence
is a powerfully useful framework for explaining why relative cavemen
like we are incapable of *demonstrating* macroscopic superpositions --
in other words, why the two branches never interfere in practice --
but it does not deny that they are still there *in principle*.

See also Roger Penrose (2004), The Road to Reality, pp. 802-803:
```
...the environmental-decoherence viewpoint ... maintains that state vector
reduction [the R process] can be understood as coming about because the
environmental system under consideration becomes inextricably entangled
with its environment.[...] We think of the environment as extremely
complicated and essentially 'random' [...] Under normal circumstances,
one must regard the density matrix as some kind of approximation to the
whole quantum truth. For there is no general principle providing an
absolute bar to extracting information from the environment.[...]
Accordingly, such descriptions are referred to as FAPP [For All Practical
Purposes]
...
Maybe a future technology could provide means whereby quantum phase
relations can be monitored in detail, under circumstances where
present-day technology would simply ‘give up’. It would seem that the
resort to a density-matrix description is a technology-dependent
prescription! With better technology, the state-vector description
could be maintained for longer, and the resort to a density matrix put
off until things get really hopelessly messy!
```

Also see [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/374212/118804).
Nonetheless, the [myth persists](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):
```
Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.
```

As an aside: the fact that it is hard in practice is what makes quantum
computing so challenging to implement.

[4] [Leonard Susskind](https://youtu.be/iNgIl-qIklU?t=3m3s), relating
how he and Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft disproved an idea of Stephen
Hawking:
```
In fact, I think of it as more basic than any of the other principles
of physics. The most basic principle of physics is that distinctions
never disappear.
```

[5] This note is for the reader who is already well-acquainted with
the math of QM (but is not necessarily acquainted with the [density
matrix formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix)). We
will omit normalization constants.

Consider a qubit in state `|psi> = |0> + |1>` measured with respect to the
basis:

`{ |A> = |0> + |1>, |B> = |0> - |1> }`

Note that because `<B|psi> = 0`, the result will never be `B`. This
result can be interpreted as the result of interference. In particular,
the "paths" leading from `|0>` to `|B>` and `|1>` to `|B>` have
opposite amplitudes and "destructively interfere."

Now let the qubit become entangled with a "measuring device":

`|psi'> = |0>|+> + |1>|->`

If you calculate the probability of `|psi'>` being measured as `|B>`
(e.g., by applying the projector `P_B @ I`), you will find that it is
50%, as would be predicted if the particle were in a classically
uncertain mixture of `|0>` and `|1>`. The interference has
"disappeared."

[6] Leaving aside the fact that in practice, information travels up
from my toe and probably reaches "me" very rapidly.
