## Summary

QM is misunderstood on all sides. Some people misunderstand and think
that conscious observers are required, and others misunderstand *back*
and say that consciousness is totally irrelevant. This see-sawing could
go on forever. I'd like to explain the mess as simply as I can.

As this article is part of a series on metaphysical idealism, you
should be unsurprised by my conclusion. Nonetheless, I believe you
are inevitably led to it. Specifically: *you* are the only observer
in your world.

## Modeling the world

This will require a bit of math, but I'm going to simplify the notation.
Bear with me.

In the two-slit experiment, when the electron (`E`) encounters the
screen, it can go one of two ways (left or right). The rest of the world
(`W`) is in some arbitrary state. We normally write this using "tensor
products" (`@`) and sums (`+`) (indicating *superposition*):

`(E left + E right) @ (W arbitrary)`

But we can take some liberties with the math-English boundary and
replace the symbols with words:

`(E left or E right) and (W arbitrary)`

At this point it is possible to detect the "or" by means of an
interference experiment. This is what causes the light and dark bands.

Now, if a detector (`D`) is placed at the slits, then the state becomes:

`[(E left and D left) or (E right and D right)] and (W arbitrary)`

This is getting messy. Luckily, we can safely leave off the rest of the
world (`W`) because of the `and`:

`(E left and D left) or (E right and D right)`

As objects (such as the detector) interact with the experiment, they move
from "rest of the world" into the experiment. In particular, since *you*
have not seen the results yet, you are still part of the `W` that we're
leaving off.

One interesting aside is that `E` is no longer in an `or` state by
itself, and so it won't show an interference pattern. Sometimes people
think this is the punchline, but it's really not.

Anyway, when the electron hits the screen (`S`), the screen registers
it on the left or right:

`(E left and D left and S left) or (E right and D right and S right)`

You can probably see where this is going. *Every* physical object that
encounters the system gets "split" in two, joining the superposition.
If this is so, then when does the `or` disappear? When do we get
**one** answer to which way the electron "really" went, instead of two?

## The measurement problem

This is the heart of the so-called "measurement problem" in QM, and
there are a few attempts at answering it. I'll share two of the more
common.

#### Collapse

One possibility is that "something" causes the system to suddenly
collapse from two to one. The problem is, there doesn't seem to be
anything that could qualify as that "something," since all physical
systems (as far as we know) simply join the superposition. It is
a sort of deus ex machina, and I think it lives on mostly
for practical reasons, sidestepping the philosophical issues.

In 1967 Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner famously proposed a thought
experiment suggesting that not only does collapse occur, but only
*conscious beings* cause it. Imagine that your friend encounters
the experiment before you do. The math suggests that he "splits" and
joins the superposition (like any other physical system), but this
"appears absurd because it implies that my friend was in a state of
suspended animation."[1] Clearly he must see one outcome or the other.
Therefore, his consciousness must have collapsed the state.

This is widely considered bogus, but as we shall soon see, Wigner's argument
was actually more nuanced than that.

#### Many worlds

Another popular answer, known as the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)
is that the two *never* become one. The
world-eating superposition grows *forever*. If that is the case, why
do I see only one result? Simple: *I don't*. "One copy" of
me sees one result, and another copy sees the other result.

Problem neatly solved, right?

Not so fast. Consider how things look for any "copy" of me.

*Before* I
encounter the experiment, I must model the state as a superposition.
The different branches can theoretically still interfere with each
other, and I should track them both. In *practice*, this is extremely
hard to do (because countless trillions of particles are interacting
with any macroscopic system), but in theory it should be possible.
This difficulty even has a shorthand: we say that it is impossible
*FAPP* ("for all practical purposes"). This is known as "decoherence."

What about *after* I encounter the experiment? When I see that the
electron went left, I am no longer free to say that it is in an
indeterminate state -- even if it is, from a "god's eye perspective."
I cannot model what is happening to my twin in the other branch, and
so I am no longer able, *even in principle*, to model this as two
branches. It has become one.

This is functionally equivalent to collapse, but now
instead of being caused by arbitrary conscious observers, it only
happens when *I* encounter the system. I am the sole observer. It is
of little consolation that this is true of "both of me."

The deus ex machina has been visibly shrunken and relocated, but it's
still alive and kicking. Actually, as we shall now see, it hasn't even
been relocated. The difficulty remains where it always was, in a place
where we would rather not find it.

## The measurement problem, take two

Let's take a step back and re-examine the measurement problem. It asks,
basically, "why do we see only one outcome, when the math predicts two?"
But "we" never see anything; only "I" do, as far as I can ever know. So
I am really asking, "why do I experience just one world?"

The measurement problem is a question about my *experience* of the
world. Yes, *maybe* other people and objects have the same difficulty,
but I'll never be able to take on their perspective and know. It makes
no difference to me.

In the case of MWI, something happens when "I encounter" the system,
but notice what
happens when we try to pin that down. What if my *toe* encounters the
experiment? No reason "I" can't treat it like any other physical system
and preserve the two branches. The change happens when the experiment
encounters... "I."

But where *exactly* do we find this I?

This is just the question of consciousness in drag. But not just *any*
consciousness; *my* consciousness. We see that Wigner understood this
well[2]:

```
This takes place whenever the result of an observation enters the
consciousness of the observer - or, to be even more painfully precise,
my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people
being only subjects of my observations.
```

Not that he particularly endorsed this conclusion:

```
However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
people, in their hearts, will go along with it.
```

But to avoid the conclusion of solipsism, he had to inject other
acrobatics. Ones that we can, in principle, falsify.

If you carefully avoid sweeping things under the rug, and follow the
empirical and theoretical results closely, you are inevitably led back
to the same squirmy conclusion: *you* are the sole observer in "your
branch of the multiverse" -- aka, what you call "the universe."

## You and consciousness

As we've seen, [consciousness](consciousness.html) can more usefully be
thought of not as a property that you have, but the very fabric from
which your world is made. From this perspective, it should come as no
surprise that this is where the rubber meets the road: it is precisely
where the world is manifested.
