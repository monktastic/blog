## Summary

The measurement problem in QM is frequently misunderstood.

In a meaningful sense, *you* are the only observer in your universe.

## Unpacked

Quantum mechanics is famously hard to understand and interpret. As a
result, there are all manner of horrible misinterpretations out there,
both from new-agers and from the skeptical community.

I'd like to cover some misconceptions.


### The two-slit experiment

I won't cover the experiment in detail here. You should watch this
video if you need a refresher. It also serves as a good example of
interpretation gone horribly wrong.



In summary: electrons behave like waves, unless a detector is present, in which
case they behave like particles. Somehow, detecting the location of a particle
prevents it from behaving like a wave and producing interference.

The “detector” in the video has an eye, and he calls it an “observer.”
From this, people may get the strange idea that some kind of conscious observer
is required to “collapse” the wave function. This is nonsense: any device
capable of giving information about the electron’s path would prevent the
interference pattern from forming.

The narrator also claims that the electron acted “as though it was aware it
was being watched.” But there’s no reason to anthropomorphize the electron.
When we bounce one pool ball off another, we don’t say that one pool ball
“is aware that it is being hit.” It’s just *being hit*, and we can use math
to predict the outcome. Similarly, when an electron wave encounters a detector,
we can use straightforward math to describe their new (joint) wave function,
and from it derive that there will be no interference. Fascinating, yes,
but not all that spooky.

From this, many conclude that measurement problem is solved and that
consciousness is irrelevant. This, too, is a mistake.

### The measurement problem

The real question is not why the interference pattern disappears. Rather,
it is: *why do we only see one outcome when there are two ways the
electron could have gone?*

To make this more precise, I'm going to use some math. Don't worry, I'll
keep it as simple as possible.

In the below, read the `@` symbol (called the "tensor product") as "and,"
and the `+` (denoting a superposition) as "or." This isn't technically
correct, as superpositions are not either/or things, but it's good enough
for now.

When the electron meets the screen and just before it encounters the
detector, we can say "the electron went left *or* electron went right,
*and* the detector is in its initial state":

`(E left + E right) @ (D initial)`

The electron is in a superposition, which is what allows for it to
interfere. But *after* it meets the detector, we know that "the electron
went left and the detector reads 'left', *or* the detector went right
and the detector reads 'right'":

`(E left @ D left) + (E right @ D right)`

There's still a superposition (`+`), but now it involves *both* E and D.
Theoretically, there should be some experiment that would demonstrate
interference for the joint system, even if we can't do it in practice.
This is important because it means that the overall system is "still
quantum": both the left and right possibilities still remain, as far as
we know. This has been amply demonstrated in many simpler setups.

When the electron encounters the screen (S), one side of it records
the contact:

`(E left @ D left @ S left) + (E right @ D right @ S right)`

As more and more physical objects encounter the experiment, this
superposition just grows and grows. And yet, we only ever see *one*
of sides of this sum: the electron either went left (and the world
agrees) or it went right.

The question of how this happens is called the measurement problem. Put
simply: why do we see only *one* outcome when the math shows many?

### Common solutions

There are two common solutions to the problem (though others exist).

One camp says that something called a "collapse" happens, which reduces
the state into just one part. But this comes with a host of problems
(nobody is sure why or when it would happen, and it introduces a new
time-irreversible law that's rather ugly). Plus, there just isn't a lot
of evidence for it. As far as I can tell, it's mostly used for
convenience to bypass the philosophical issues.

The second is the "many worlds interpretation" (MWI). It says that the
system *never* reduces to one. Instead, when you encounter the system,
*you* join the superposition. There are then *two* copies of you: one
that sees the electron go left and one that sees it go right. So the
question "why do I only see one outcome" is "you don't!"

### Consciousness

Let's revisit the measurement problem: "why do I see only one outcome?"
What do we mean by "I see"? We mean "I experience"; "I am conscious
of." The measurement problem arises as a natural result of the sense
that *I experience a (singular) world.*

For all I know, maybe this applies to other objects and people, too.
I'd certainly like to *believe* it's true of other people, but maybe
I'll never know.

But I *do* know that it seems like a world is appearing before me now.
So while there might be "another me" asking the same question in another
world, it's still interesting to ask about "this one."


### You are the sole observer
