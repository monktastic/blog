Is the world made of *stuff*, or is physical reality more akin to a *dream*? 
And if a dream, *whose* dream? Yours? God's? Or perhaps, as many mystical 
contemplative traditions claim, what's "looking out your eyes" ultimately *is* 
God?

Is there even any way to be sure which is true? And if not, do such questions
matter?

[Idealism vs Materialism](http://philosophyterms.com/idealism/#III_Idealism_vs_Materialism)

> *Idealism and materialism are both impossible to prove or disprove, of course — they’re unfalsifiable statements, which means there’s no neutral test that could weigh them against each other. The test, ultimately, has to be one of intuition, or “gut reaction.” Many people find that materialism makes more sense because, after all, everyone has the experience of interacting with an outside world and believing that’s really “out there.” On the other hand, it’s impossible for us to step “outside” our own minds, so how can we be so sure that there really is an “out there” at all?*

But if this really were "your" dream, then it ought to be possible to discover, 
very precisely, the trick by which you weave this fantastic story and lose yourself 
in it -- currently, as the very flesh-and-blood avatar reading this piece. 
You ought to even be able to regain *control* of this 
process, so that you could demonstrate to your satisfaction -- *as much 
satisfaction as you dared* -- that this is, in fact, all that has been happening 
for your apparent life, and indeed, for anything you could ever meaningfully call 
"life."

On the other hand, upon seeing this, your next course of action might be to
reconstruct the avatar and continue the dream in such a way that most
of the understanding is lost. Depending on
your intentions for that avatar, she might be at a stage where memory of
the truth is not the ideal continuation of her storyline. That would manifest,
of course, as something like her disbelief or apathy toward such topics as the
present one.

If that seems to describe your current condition, then this series is probably
not for you. Or at least, not for you right now.

This is a very challenging topic to write about. If what I'm saying is true,
there seems to be no way to convince you of it. It's not even clear why "I"
would be *trying* to convince "you." Furthermore, even if you *did*
become intellectually convinced, it's not clear that it would do you any good.
You'd maybe have a "whoa" moment and go on with your life.

Nonetheless, this series will be written as though it *is* true (as far as
language can capture), and as though I *am* trying to convince you.

Though You have the power to conjure realities so fiendishly clever,
internally consistent, and profoundly intricate that they can fool you for a 
*very* long while, the one thing You cannot do is be fooled forever. In every 
dream you manifest, you always leave a few loose ends: threads of the sweater 
which, if pulled carefully enough, threaten to unravel the whole ruse. It is
like climbing into a magical sack and trying to sew it shut from the inside:
a seam will always be visible.

All I can do is to try and point out some of these seams. It is up to you to 
decide whether they represent genuine inconsistencies worthy of closer 
investigation, or foolish misinterpretations of facts which obviously belong to 
an entirely mundane world.
