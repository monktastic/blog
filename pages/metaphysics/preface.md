Is the world made of *stuff*, or is physical reality more akin to a *dream*? 
And if a dream, *whose* dream? Yours? God's? Or perhaps, as many mystical 
contemplative traditions claim, what's "looking out your eyes" ultimately *is* 
God?

Is there even any way to be sure which is true? And if not, do such questions
matter?

[Idealism vs Materialism](http://philosophyterms.com/idealism/#III_Idealism_vs_Materialism)

> *Idealism and materialism are both impossible to prove or disprove, of course — they’re unfalsifiable statements, which means there’s no neutral test that could weigh them against each other. The test, ultimately, has to be one of intuition, or “gut reaction.” Many people find that materialism makes more sense because, after all, everyone has the experience of interacting with an outside world and believing that’s really “out there.” On the other hand, it’s impossible for us to step “outside” our own minds, so how can we be so sure that there really is an “out there” at all?*

But if this really is "your" dream, then it ought to be possible to discover, 
very precisely, the trick by which you weave this fantastic phantasmagoria and 
lose yourself in it -- in the guise of the very flesh-and-blood avatar reading 
this piece now. You ought to even be able to regain *control* of this
process, so that you could demonstrate to your satisfaction -- *as much 
satisfaction as you dared* -- that this is, in fact, all that has been happening 
for your apparent life, and indeed, for anything you might ever meaningfully 
*call* "life."

> *At first when you pass into the dream state and images arise, you may not remember where they came from. Your awareness, however, will naturally develop until you will be able to see that you are dreaming. When you watch very carefully, you will be able to see the whole creation and evolution of the dream.
  ... With continuing practice, we see less and less difference between the waking and the dream state.*
>
> -- Tarthang Tulku

> *When you start to dream, the dream begins as a thought, like one you would have in the daytime. But you’re asleep, so the thought intensifies and becomes something like talk or gossip, and then the gossip intensifies or solidifies into images, and then you really think that you’re seeing people, seeing places, going places, and so on. And that is how it works with conventional appearances as well.*
>
> -- Thrangu Rinpoche

> *In the beginning was the Thought, and the Thought was with God, and the
Thought was God.*
>
> -- John 1:1, [alternative translation](http://pathosethoslogos.com/)

On the other hand, having peeked behind the curtain, your next course of action 
might be to reconstruct the dream and continue it in such a way that most
of that understanding is lost. Depending on your intentions for the avatar, 
she might be at a stage where memory of the Truth is not the ideal continuation 
of her storyline. That would manifest as something like her disbelief or 
apathy toward such topics as the present one, as well as a thorough
lack of evidence of the Truth in her surroundings.

If that seems to describe your current condition, then this series is probably
not for you.

This is a very challenging topic to write about. If what I'm saying is true,
there seems to be no way to convince you of it. It's not even clear why "I"
would be *trying* to convince "you." Furthermore, even if you *did*
become intellectually convinced, it's not clear that it would do you any good.
You'd maybe have a "whoa" moment and go on with your life.

Nonetheless, this series will be written as though it *is* true (as far as
language can capture), and as though I *am* trying to convince you.

Though You have the power to conjure realities so fiendishly clever,
internally consistent, and profoundly intricate that they can fool You for a 
*very* long while, the one thing You cannot do is be fooled forever. In every 
dream You manifest, You always leave a few loose ends: threads of the sweater 
which, if pulled carefully enough, threaten to unravel the whole ruse. It is
like climbing into a magical sack and trying to sew it shut from the inside:
a seam will always be visible.

All I can do is to try and point out some of these seams. It is up to you to 
decide whether they represent genuine inconsistencies worthy of closer 
investigation, or foolish misinterpretations of facts easily explainable by
an entirely mundane world.
