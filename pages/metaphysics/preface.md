Is the world made of *stuff*, or is physical reality more akin to a *dream*? 
And if a dream, *whose* dream? Yours? God's? Or perhaps, as many contemplative 
traditions claim, what's "looking out your eyes" ultimately *is* God?

Is there even any way to be sure which is true? Perhaps not, and such questions
are pointless philosophizing.

[Idealism vs Materialism](http://philosophyterms.com/idealism/#III_Idealism_vs_Materialism)

> *Idealism and materialism are both impossible to prove or disprove, of course — they’re unfalsifiable statements, which means there’s no neutral test that could weigh them against each other. The test, ultimately, has to be one of intuition, or “gut reaction.” Many people find that materialism makes more sense because, after all, everyone has the experience of interacting with an outside world and believing that’s really “out there.” On the other hand, it’s impossible for us to step “outside” our own minds, so how can we be so sure that there really is an “out there” at all?*

It seems we are at an impasse.

Thousands of smart people before you have tried and failed to settle the
question definitively; does that mean that you should give up, too? Certainly 
if we were talking about a hypothesis in, say, physics, the odds of you 
resolving an open question would be stacked mightily against you. There are 
better uses of your time than trying to outsmart a large community of 
brilliant people.

But if this really is all "your" dream, then it would be silly to wait for 
*someone else* to prove it. In fact, it would be silly to even wait for
*evidence* of the fact, for only *your mind* could allow such evidence into the
dream. The apparent lack of evidence doesn't prove that it's *not* a dream; it 
only suggests that *you are not yet ready to find out.* Once you are ready, 
perhaps the dream will begin to provide evidence -- *as much evidence as 
necessary* -- for you to wake up.
 
So the symmetry between the two possibilities is broken. If the world is 
material, then you are doomed to forever question whether or not it is all a 
dream. But if it *is* a dream, then you can answer the question definitively. 
All you have to do is wake up.

---

As in nighttime dreams, "waking up" doesn't necessarily entail the dream
*ending.* In a lucid dream, it is possible to "wake up" and remain *in* the
dream. With enough practice, you can gain precise insight into all the details 
of how the dream is created and maintained, possibly even taking control of the
process.

> *At first when you pass into the dream state and images arise, you may not remember where they came from. Your awareness, however, will naturally develop until you will be able to see that you are dreaming. When you watch very carefully, you will be able to see the whole creation and evolution of the dream.
  ... With continuing practice, we see less and less difference between the waking and the dream state.*
>
> -- Tarthang Tulku (Tibetan Buddhist master)

> *When you start to dream, the dream begins as a thought, like one you would have in the daytime. But you’re asleep, so the thought intensifies and becomes something like talk or gossip, and then the gossip intensifies or solidifies into images, and then you really think that you’re seeing people, seeing places, going places, and so on. And that is how it works with conventional appearances as well.*

> -- Thrangu Rinpoche (Tibetan Buddhist master)

> *In the beginning was the Thought, and the Thought was with God, and the
Thought was God.*

You might even choose to continue the dream, losing (almost) all conscious
recognition of the Truth if it doesn't suit your character's storyline. All
you'd need to do is generate a little bit (or even a whole lot!) of internal 
consistency in the dream, but equip the character with insufficient tools to 
detect or care about any discrepancies. That way, she wouldn't notice anything
amiss without some *very sincere* investigation.

The central thread of this series is that this is precisely the condition you 
currently find yourself in, and you can find your way out if you so choose.
Nothing in the universe can stop you, other than the roadblocks you continually
erect for yourself.

Though you have the power to conjure realities so fiendishly clever,
internally consistent, and profoundly intricate that they can fool you for a
*very* long while, the one thing you cannot do is be fooled forever. In every
dream you manifest, you always leave a few loose ends: threads of the sweater
which, if pulled sincerely enough, begin to unravel the whole ruse. It is
like climbing into a magical sack and trying to sew it shut from the inside:
a seam will always remain visible.

All I can do is to try and point out some of these seams. It is up to you to 
decide whether they represent genuine inconsistencies worthy of closer 
investigation, or foolish misinterpretations of facts easily explainable by
an entirely mundane world.

<!-- TODO

Some of this material may sound crazy to you. You should be grateful for that
mechanism; it's defending you from learning more than you currently feeling
ready for.

What prevents you from discovering that this is a dream is that every time you
start looking into the possibility, you quickly become dissuaded by circular
reasoning.

Consider:

> *Idealism and materialism are both impossible to prove or disprove, of course — they’re unfalsifiable statements, which means there’s no neutral test that could weigh them against each other. The test, ultimately, has to be one of intuition, or “gut reaction.”

Is it really true that there is no neutral test t

If this really is your dream, then might it not be
possible to demonstrate that fact beyond any reasonable doubt? Be creative here.
