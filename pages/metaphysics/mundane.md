```

Why is it that the word "mundane" means both "pertaining to physical reality"
and "tedious; repetitive and boring"? After all, it is certainly quite possible 
to experience physical reality as incredibly beautiful and awe-inspiring.

One possibility is that we hanker for magical experiences; anything that would
rescue us from the shackles of everyday life. Our wishful thinking makes us
dream of a supernatural world, and so the *real* world is dull by comparison
with that fantasy.

But I'd like to offer another possibility: physical reality feels vaguely dull 
and repetitive because you take it far too literally.

The reason that your life does not feel overwhelmingly glorious and infinitely 
wondrous is that you feel a deep-seated certainty that you know, more 
or less, how it all works. In short: reality is a collection of stuff, 
interacting through time and space, according to fixed laws.
Sure, there are a few little details for physicists to iron out, but the basic 
structure is in place and is pretty much incontrovertible.

*This* moment is nothing special because you had one very much like it just a 
moment ago, and a moment before that, in a series of moments stretching back to
your birth. Been there, done that. Because of this you seek out special 
experiences -- a trip to the symphony, or a Michelin starred restaurant --
but even those moments differ from previous ones only in a few small details: 
the sound is a little sweeter; the flavor a little richer. On rare occasion 
they briefly transport you to another world: a little taste of transcendence 
before the mental chatter swoops back in and puts a lid on the affair.

In between these moments of ennui your daily experience is subtly conditioned 
by a veritable smorgasbord of neuroses: regrets, resentments, anxieties, and
fears -- all of which depend, inextricably, on your wholehearted faith in the
fundamental reality of time.

But this is just the price you pay for being real. Far better to bravely face
up to the facts than to escape to some fantasy world, after all. Time is just 
a brute fact of life, and the best we can hope to do is make peace with it, 
right?

But have you ever stopped to consider *why*, exactly, you are so dead certain
about the nature of time? Has it really earned the undying allegiance
you have pledged it?

---

On the face of it, the question might seem absurd: *obviously* it is logical to
believe in time, and illogical to believe otherwise.

But careful reasoning reveals that
it is no more logical to believe in the past than not: all attempts to justify
time end up *presupposing* it in one way or another. And something with only
*circular* justification has *no* justification. Spend as much time as you need
to convince yourself of this fact: there is no (non-circular) evidence of a
past.

Okay, well if it is not *logical*, then at least it is *practical*, right? But
even this conclusion is circular: how can you know whether something is
*practical* if this is the only moment that exists? You have to assume that
there have been other moments to determine whether the belief has been 
practical.

Once you really see this, there's not much more you can do than throw your 
hands up and say "reasoning be damned; I am fine treating time as an
assumption!"

Which is perfectly fine -- unless you happen to be the kind of person who wants
to understand *why* you do things. Where exactly does this compulsion to believe 
come from, if not from logic? *Why* do I believe?

One easy answer is that perhaps "my reptilian brain is causing me to do it, and 
my prefrontal cortex has no say in the matter." This is certainly internally
consistent: it's evolutionarily advantageous to believe in things that are real,
so perhaps it's been built deep into our brain structures. 

On the other hand, if the world popped into being *now*, I'd *still* be giving 
this answer. So maybe it's not so satisfying after all.

Every time we try to answer *why*, our mind produces a satisfying explanation 
that requires careful consideration to detect as circular. 
It is as though the mind is erecting one "Do Not Enter" sign after another to
dissuade you from peeking behind the curtain. "It's logical." "It's practical."
"It's inevitable." "Shut up, we like it."

We are like Truman in the Truman Show, as the show's producers generate an 
increasingly stormy sea to prevent him from discovering the truth.

<!-- TODO: Not coincidentally, the "Truman Show Effect" is common on strong
psychedelics. -->

It's a rare individual who cares enough about the truth to actually proceed
beyond this point. If you're perfectly content with your worldview and would
rather not rock the boat too much, this is probably a good time to find 
something better to do. On the other hand, it's probably safe to proceed anyway:
your mind has a dazzling array of powerful defense mechanisms to protect you 
from seeing too much, too soon.

If you could perceive the sense in which this is the first (and possibly only) 
moment of existence, you would be overcome by a glory so profound that it 
literally cannot be imagined -- or even believed -- within your current
cognitive structures.

We all know that there is reality "out there," and our own personal experience
of it "in here." We only ever interact with our own personal projection of it, 
and never with reality itself.

Through the practice of meditation, you can discover that you do not only
*interact* with the projection "in here," but that you actively *create* it.
This creation process is happening at such a subtle layer of mind that you are
normally unaware of it, and believe it to be happening *to* you.

As you become aware of this creation process, you begin to discover something
funny: your belief in a reality "out there" is *also* a construction of this
process. You also begin to notice *why* you are constructing this belief.

At your current layer of mind, it seems that your belief in time is purely
rational. Even if you use logic to discover why the process is *not* rational,
it still *feels* rational. At the very least, you can say that you do it
because it *works.*

As your awareness becomes more subtle, you discover that you are doing it for
purely *emotional* reasons.

“By observing the nature of the mind in both its active and passive states, it eventually becomes clear that all objects of consciousness are constructs of the mind. All we’ve ever known is what the mind itself has produced. The true nature of these mind-made objects of consciousness is simply the nature of mind itself. You may have already grasped this intellectually, but you now experience it directly. True, there may have been some external stimulus that caused your unconscious sub-minds to project a particular object into consciousness, but all we can ever observe is the mental object, a product of the mind itself—not the source of the original stimulus. To put it another way, the “thing-in-itself” that stimulated the mind to produce the object can never be observed. The mind creates its own “reality,” made entirely of cognitive-emotional constructs produced in response to unknown, and ultimately unknowable, forces acting on the mind through the senses. Furthermore, the perceived appearance of these constructs has far more to do with the nature of the constructing mind than with the actual sources of sensory data. The one thing we can be sure of is that the true nature of that unknown source is quite different from anything the mind projects.”

“It’s especially important not to be deceived by mere intellectual understanding. You may think you “got it” just by reading this description. However, many philosophers and scientists have understood this truth intellectually, but it hasn’t transformed them. We haven’t gotten it until this Insight completely transforms the way we perceive the world—especially during challenging times, like when we’re in an argument with our boss or partner, in a traffic jam, or when our house burns down.”
