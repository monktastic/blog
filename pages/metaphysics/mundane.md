mundane /ˌmənˈdān/:

1. Worldly, earthly, profane, vulgar as opposed to heavenly.
2. Pertaining to the Universe, cosmos or physical reality, as opposed to the spiritual world.
3. Ordinary; not new.
4. Tedious; repetitive and boring.
```

Why is it that the word "mundane" means both "pertaining to physical reality"
and "tedious; repetitive and boring"? After all, it is certainly quite possible 
to see physical reality as incredibly beautiful and awe-inspiring. Ideas
like evolution and the Big Bang are genuinely marvelous.

But I'd like to offer another perspective.

The reason that your life does not feel overwhelmingly glorious and 
infinitely wondrous right now is that you feel a deep-seated certainty that you 
know, more or less, how it all works. In short: reality is a bunch of stuff, 
interacting through time and space. Sure, there are a few little details for 
physicists to work out, but the basic structure is in place and pretty much 
incontrovertible.

This moment is nothing special because you had one very much like it just a 
moment ago, and a moment before that, in a series of moments stretching back to
your birth. You've been here before, more or less. Sometimes you have special 
experiences, sure -- a trip to the symphony, or a Michelin starred restaurant --
but even those moments differ from previous ones only in a few small details: 
the sound is a little sweeter; the flavor a little richer. On rare occasion 
they transport you to another world: a little taste of transcendence before 
your worldview swoops back in and constrains the process.

[Regrets, resentments, anxieties, fears]

[On the other hand, it is practical. Time is clearly important in some way.]

You might begin to wonder: *why* do I believe in time? A good first guess is 
that I believe because it's *logical*. But careful reasoning will reveal that 
it is no more logical to believe in the past than not.

Okay, well if it is not *logical*, then at least it is *practical*, right? But
even this conclusion is circular: how can you know whether something is
*practical* if this is the only moment that exists? Your belief in time, as
well as your belief that this belief is reasonable or practical, cannot really
be justified. There's really not much more you can do than throw your hands up
and say "well, I choose to believe anyway!"

Which is perfectly fine -- unless you happen to be the kind of person who wants
to understand *why* things happen. Where exactly does this compulsion of mine
come from, if not from logic? 

One easy answer is that perhaps "my reptilian brain is causing me to do it, and 
my prefrontal cortex has no say in the matter." This is certainly internally
consistent: it's evolutionarily advantageous to believe in things that are real,
so perhaps it's been built deep into our brain structures. Okay, but if the
world popped into being *now*, I'd *still* be giving this answer, so maybe it's
not so satisfying after all.

As you can see, the mind will erect one "Do Not Enter" sign after another to
dissuade you from peeking behind the curtain. "It's logical." "It's practical."
"It's inevitable."

It's a rare individual who cares enough about the truth to actually proceed
beyond this point. If you're perfectly content with your worldview and would
rather not rock the boat too much, this is a good time to find something better
to do.

We all know that there is reality "out there," and our own personal experience
of it "in here." We only ever interact with our own personal projection of it, 
and never with reality itself.

Through the practice of meditation, you can discover that you do not only
*interact* with the projection "in here," but that you actively *create* it.
This creation process is happening at such a subtle layer of mind that you are
normally unaware of it, and believe it to be happening *to* you.

As you become aware of this creation process, you begin to discover something
funny: your belief in a reality "out there" is *also* a construction of this
process. You also begin to notice *why* you are constructing this belief.

At your current layer of mind, it seems that your belief in time is purely
rational. Even if you use logic to discover why the process is *not* rational,
it still *feels* rational. At the very least, you can say that you do it
because it *works.*

As your awareness becomes more subtle, you discover that you are doing it for
purely *emotional* reasons.
