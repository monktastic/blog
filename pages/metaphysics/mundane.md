Why is it that the word "mundane" means both "pertaining to physical reality"
and "tedious; repetitive and boring"? After all, it is certainly quite possible 
to experience physical reality as incredibly beautiful and awe-inspiring.

One possibility is that we hanker for magical experiences; anything that would
rescue us from the shackles of everyday life. Our wishful thinking makes us
dream of a supernatural world, and so the *real* world is dull by comparison
with that fantasy.

But I'd like to offer another possibility: physical reality feels vaguely dull 
and repetitive because you take it far too literally.

The reason that your life does not feel overwhelmingly glorious and infinitely 
wondrous is that you feel a deep-seated certainty that you know, more 
or less, how it all works. In short: reality is a collection of stuff, 
interacting through time and space, according to fixed laws.
Sure, there are a few little details for physicists to iron out, but the basic 
structure is in place and is pretty much incontrovertible.

This moment is nothing special because you had one very much like it just a 
moment ago, and a moment before that, in a series of moments stretching back to
your birth. Been there, done that. Because of this, you seek out special 
experiences to spice things up -- a trip to the symphony, or a Michelin starred 
restaurant -- but even those moments differ from previous ones only in a few 
small details: the sound is a little sweeter; the flavor a little richer. On 
rare occasion they briefly transport you to another world: a little taste of 
transcendence before the mental chatter swoops back in and puts a lid on the 
affair.

In between these moments of ennui your daily experience is subtly conditioned 
by a veritable smorgasbord of neuroses: regrets, resentments, anxieties, and
fears -- all of which depend, inextricably, on your wholehearted faith in the
fundamental reality of time.

If you could perceive the sense in which this is the *first* (and possibly *only*) 
moment of existence, you would be overcome by a glory so profound that it 
cannot be imagined -- let alone experienced -- within your current cognitive 
confines.

But this is just the price you pay for being real. Far better to bravely face
up to the facts than to escape to some fantasy world, after all. Time is just 
a brute fact of life, and the best we can hope to do is make peace with it, 
right?

But have you ever stopped to consider *why*, exactly, you are so dead certain
about the nature of time? Has it really earned the undying allegiance
you have so obsequiously pledged it?

“By observing the nature of the mind in both its active and passive states, it eventually becomes clear that all objects of consciousness are constructs of the mind. All we’ve ever known is what the mind itself has produced. The true nature of these mind-made objects of consciousness is simply the nature of mind itself. You may have already grasped this intellectually, but you now experience it directly. True, there may have been some external stimulus that caused your unconscious sub-minds to project a particular object into consciousness, but all we can ever observe is the mental object, a product of the mind itself—not the source of the original stimulus. To put it another way, the “thing-in-itself” that stimulated the mind to produce the object can never be observed. The mind creates its own “reality,” made entirely of cognitive-emotional constructs produced in response to unknown, and ultimately unknowable, forces acting on the mind through the senses. Furthermore, the perceived appearance of these constructs has far more to do with the nature of the constructing mind than with the actual sources of sensory data. The one thing we can be sure of is that the true nature of that unknown source is quite different from anything the mind projects.”

“It’s especially important not to be deceived by mere intellectual understanding. You may think you “got it” just by reading this description. However, many philosophers and scientists have understood this truth intellectually, but it hasn’t transformed them. We haven’t gotten it until this Insight completely transforms the way we perceive the world—especially during challenging times, like when we’re in an argument with our boss or partner, in a traffic jam, or when our house burns down.”
