### Summary

There is no (logical) reason to believe that the "laws of nature" will
continue to operate in the future.

See [David Hume's Problem of Induction](stephenlaw.blogspot.com/2012/10/problem-of-induction-explained-simply.html).

Briefly: the idea that things will *continue* to be true because they *have
been true* in the past is called the *principle of induction*. How do we
justify this principle? By observing that it's been true in
the past, and therefore will continue to be in the future. In other words,
the principle of induction is only justified via induction. This is circular
reasoning, and thus invalid.

How can we know that the laws of nature will not suddenly stop or change
five seconds from now?
Because they have been so regular in the past? What is to 
*prevent* things from suddenly changing? Is there a universal police force 
enforcing these "laws" of nature? If they were to suddenly change, wouldn't we
simply look back and say "ah, we've discovered a new law?"

It is commonly understood to mean "we cannot be *certain* of the future,"
but it cuts far deeper than that. It says that there is *no logical
justification* for the belief:

> *If Hume is right, the belief that the sun will rise tomorrow is **as unjustified** as the belief that a million mile wide bowl of tulips will appear over the horizon instead. We suppose the second belief is insane.*
> ... 
> *But then the onus is on these defenders of “common 
   sense” to show precisely what is wrong with Hume’s argument. No one has 
   yet succeeded in doing this (or at least no one has succeeded in 
   convincing a majority of philosophers that they have done so).*

As with the belief in the past, it may be *practical* to assume that they
will continue to hold, but this is different from it being justified on
logical grounds.

Hume:

> *Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument which
I have been to such pains to inculcate, whether I be really one of those
skeptics who hold that everything is uncertain, I should reply that
neither I nor any other person was ever sincerely and constantly of
that opinion. I dine, I play backgammon, I converse and am merry with
my friends and when after three or four hours of amusement I would return
to these speculations, they appear so cold and strange and ridiculous
that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any further. **Thus the
skeptic still continues to reason and believe, though he asserts he
cannot defend his reason by reason.***

> *[Wheeler would] say things like, “In the end, the only law is that
  there is no law.” There’s no ultimate law of physics. All the laws of
  physics are mutable and that mutability itself is a principle of physics. He’d
  say, there’s no law of physics that hasn't been transcended. I saw this, and
  I remembered my joke about how the laws of physics must be wrong, and I was
  immensely attracted to this idea that maybe ultimately there actually are no
  laws of physics. What there is in place of laws, I didn't know. But if the
  laws weren't 100 percent trustworthy, maybe there was a back door to the
  stars.*
