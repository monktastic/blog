Recall the following idea from the ["mundane"](mundane.html)
chapter:

> If you could perceive the sense in which this is the *first* (and possibly *only*) 
moment of existence, you would be overcome by heartbreaking beauty so exquisite 
that it cannot be imagined -- let alone experienced -- within your current 
cognitive confines.

If you're honest with yourself, you'll by now see that there's only one thing
holding you back from such perception. It's a persistent belief in something
that has *no logical basis*. As hinted at before, we can transcend the
*literalness* of this construct while still being able to use it *functionally*.

People often try to approximate this by "being in the moment," but this is not
yet all the way there. Buddhist teacher Rob Burbea:

> [A]lthough it can be a helpful way of looking for a while to see that “it’s always the present”, that “only Now exists”, or even that “Being is endlessly Now”, such notions reify and sometimes eternalize ‘the now’. Just as with perceptions of flow, eventually the present needs to be seen through also. ‘Being in the now’ is most certainly not the goal of practice. Realizing the emptiness of all time – past, future, and present – is essential to a more radical liberation. Such insight is accessible through a range of means and will ultimately take us even deeper into the mystery of dependent origination.

Two quotes from Tsoknyi Rinpoche:

> Most people can give up the past. Some people are able to give up the future too. But rare are those who can give up the present.


> The present awareness which experiences right now is resting on this moment. Present mind is dwelling on the present moment, but in a fixated sort of way. According to Dzogchen, that becomes an obstacle for meditation practice. From the viewpoint of another [sect], it may not be an obstacle. There are many spiritual paths in this world, and plenty of instructions that say, “Don’t worry, just be here now!” This is basically okay, it can be very helpful—but in the end, you still are stuck with this “Be here now.”

> Dzogchen maintains that you must transcend that thought construct as well, making way for openness, unimpededness, in Tibetan called sangtal. This is the point where nowness vanishes, when it is no longer an object remaining. This may sound like it’s all a little above our heads; but on the other hand, it is true. First we need to have some sense of nowness, of being present, and to cultivate it, and afterwards dismantle that as well. But if we have no idea at all of nowness, then what it means to be free of nowness is only crazy talk.

As Tsoknyi Rinpoche says, this may sound a little too far-out to be very useful. 
But even "being here now" is itself very beneficial, and it fits well within
our worldview. A useful addition is to practice being profoundly grateful for the 
splendor of this moment, no matter what it contains. As with forgiveness, this 
"radical" aspect can be especially healing in moments where our conventional 
perspective is screaming that we ought *not* to be grateful.

Sometimes when we do this, surprising avenues open up in our situation that we
may otherwise not have noticed. Did those avenues even *exist* before we
transformed our perception? Obviously your conventional mind will scream "yes,"
but here we're trying to explore what happens when you give up some of your
certainty -- which, as we've taken pains to point out, isn't always as logical 
as you'd like to believe.
