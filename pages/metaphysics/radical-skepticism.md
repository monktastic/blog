## Summary

Your belief in time is based entirely on circular reasoning. As such,
it has **no** justification other than "it feels good."

This conclusion is unavoidable, but probably rubs you the wrong way.
When you try to understand *why* it rubs you the wrong way, you fall
into the jaws of circular reasoning again, you silly bastard.

If you can avoid this trap for long enough to see what's really going
on in your mind, you cannot help but be overcome by profound humility
and the heartfelt recognition that one has been taking existence utterly
for granted, for the misguided reason that "it feels good."

## Proving the past

Let us try to prove that the past really happened.

* Well, here is a picture I took five minutes ago.

Okay, but for all you know, reality popped into existence just *now*,
with that picture in place to fool you, and memories to go along with it.

* Yes *maybe*, but that's extremely unlikely. Reality doesn't work that
way.

It doesn't work that way *assuming what you've learned in the past is
true*.

* Fine, but Occam's Razor suggests that time is the simpler explanation.

And how do you justify Occam's Razor?

* It has worked in the...

Past? Nice try. What else you got?

* Well, at least it is the most *productive* belief.

How do you *know* it's productive without trusting in the past?

* Okay, *fine*. It just *feels right.*

Bingo. Ultimately, all the other justifications are cover stories. We
cannot even say it is *likely* that time exists, without making
assumptions that we justify by assuming a past.

If it's not based in reason, why do you believe in it *so strongly?*

Even if you manage to undo the intellectual belief, something in your
gut isn't quite on board. *Why?*

* Hmm. Probably because it's *true* and thus it confers evolutionary
fitness to believe it, so it's been baked into my reptilian brain over
the...

Years? Boy, you *really* can't let go of this circular reasoning thing,
can you?

---

The point isn't that the reasoning is *wrong.* It's certainly
internally consistent. The point is to notice how you have *no reason*
to believe any of it, and yet it is *so comforting* whenever you think
you've found a reason.

We're trying to pry your fingers off the cliff, but at every step you
find a new ledge to catch yourself on.

What happens when you let go?


## Humility and gratitude

If you let go very briefly (leaving aside what "brief" means if there's
no time...), it may feel like an "oh, sh*t" moment. Like you're suddenly
falling. Then, very quickly, the circular reasoning comes back online in
various subtle ways and makes it feel like you're on solid ground again.

You're not. It's an illusion.

That mechanism is there to make you feel safe. "If you stop believing
in time, you'll go crazy!" Actually, you can have a completely
*functional* belief in time without taking it *literally*.

So what happens if you keep going?

When you're so sure of the past, it's hardly a surprise when you
discover that you and the world exist in this moment. You've existed
for quite a while, and the world even longer. What's so special?

You literally take existence for granted, all because you are convinced
of a worldview for which you cannot find a basis.

If you managed to *stop* taking it all for granted, you would be
greeted with the *overwhelming miracle of existence*. As far as you can
possibly know, you are alive for the first time **right now**. And it
is possible to *see* this, if you would just stop grasping at straws.

You can probably sense that there's something impossibly precious
about being alive, but it is always colored by your metaphysics. You
have no choice but to couch it in terms of your concepts.
Something about the Big Bang, or evolution, or neuroscience. Those are
all incredibly wondrous, no doubt. But a genuinely transcendent
experience only happens when you *transcend* your entire belief
structure*.

## What comes next?

As you sit here and imagine it, you can't help but think something
like "oh, maybe I'll transcend the *idea* of time, but it will obviously
continue to exist 'out there.'" There it is again, the belief that *even
though I have no reason for this belief, it **must** be true.*

Look into your justification for that belief. Maybe something about
how you've never seen anyone else transcend time? I won't deconstruct
that here, because I trust you now have the tools to do it yourself --
if you feel called down the rabbit hole.

But this is a good question to look into: *I believe that letting go
of belief can't actually change anything in the world "out there." What
would happen if I deeply let go of **that** belief?*

[This](consciousness.html) is [your world](quantum.html), after all.
You may have to do some digging through the
[layers of mind](layers-of-mind.html) that construct it, but it's
ultimately up to you.

## Notes and references

\* And here I depart with seemingly-sensible claims like
[this article on near-death experiences](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-popularity-of-near-death-experience/#!):

```
Here they echo the pushback that atheists (Alain de Botton, most
notably) have recently given to the religiously minded who insist that
a physicalist outlook must inevitably drain the world of its emotional
or spiritual resonance, leaving a sterile, inhuman void. Only an
impoverished imagination can credit such an assumption. A wholly natural
world offers us ample opportunity for self-transcendence and meaning,
an abundance of chances to achieve a perspective distinct from or
“greater than” ourselves. Yet taking this “different perspective does
not force us to believe in a different reality or realm of being.”
```

Religion and science can lift you up to the *precipice* of
transcendence, perhaps, but you cannot hold on to the ledge and let go
at the same time.

#### Random notes

* [The Omphalos Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos_hypothesis).
A young earth creationist belief that says the world was created less
than ten thousand years ago, with merely the appearance of being much
older (as a test by God).

* [The church of Last Thursday](http://www.last-thursday.org/). A
rationalist "church" suggesting that the world sprang into being last
Thursday.

* The mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell takes it one step further:

> "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past."

But ultimately loses courage:

> “Skepticism, while **logically impeccable**, is **psychologically
impossible**, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any
philosophy which pretends to accept it.”

* David Hume (whose brilliant Problem of Induction similarly
deconstructs the future):

> "Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument which
I have been to such pains to inculcate, whether I be really one of those
skeptics who hold that everything is uncertain, I should reply that
neither I nor any other person was ever sincerely and constantly of
that opinion. I dine, I play backgammon, I converse and am merry with
my friends and when after three or four hours of amusement I would return
to these speculations, they appear so cold and strange and ridiculous
that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any further. Thus the
skeptic still continues to reason and believe, though he asserts he
**cannot defend his reason by reason.**"

* Modern physicist Sean Carroll:

> “There is **no way** to distinguish between the scenarios by
collecting new data.
>
> What we’re left with is our choice of prior credences. We’re allowed
to pick priors however we want—and every possibility should get some
nonzero number. But it’s okay to set our prior credence in radically
skeptical scenarios at very low values, and attach higher prior credence
to the straightforwardly realistic possibilities.
>
> Radical skepticism is less useful to us; it gives us no way to go
through life. All of our purported knowledge, and all of our goals and
aspirations, might very well be tricks being played on us. But what
then? We cannot actually act on such a belief, since any act we might
think is reasonable would have been suggested to us by that annoying
demon. Whereas, if we take the world roughly at face value, we have a
way of moving forward. There are things we want to do, questions we
want to answer, and strategies for making them happen. **We have every
right to give high credence to views of the world that are productive
and fruitful, in preference to those that would leave us paralyzed
with ennui.**”
