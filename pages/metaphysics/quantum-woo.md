### Summary

If quantum mechanics is correct, then in a *physically verifiable sense*, you 
are the sole observer in your world. This is a straightforward result, and the
natural outcome of making as few assumptions as possible. Nonetheless, it is
extremely psychologically challenging, so feel free to label it "quantum woo."

It's very hard to do justice to this argument in a short space, but I'm going 
to try. I will out of necessity have to gloss over some details. I will try to
be clear about which parts are well-accepted and which are not.
A slightly richer version of this piece (with some math in the footnotes)
can be found [here](pick-your-poison.html).

**Caveat**: I am not a physicist. Nonetheless, I can tell you a bit about 
density operators on Hilbert space, which is all that is needed to work out
the math yourself. Also, I've run this by enough physicists to confirm this 
conclusion:

> *I suspect that a substantial majority of physicists who use quantum
  mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright
  hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.*

I hope to help you appreciate the source of that hostility.

In the most commonly presented formulation of quantum mechanics, there are two
rules according to which a quantum state can evolve. Don't worry if you don't
understand all the words yet:

1. "Normally," it faithfully adheres to the Schrodinger equation, according to
linear, deterministic dynamics.

2. When the state is "measured," it seems to instantaneously and randomly jump
("collapse") to a state where it either definitely does or does not have the 
property being measured. The probabilities depend on the state before 
measurement.

I want you to ignore rule (2) for now. As we shall see, it exists only
to make sense of our perceived experience, as opposed to having a physical
justification. Very few modern physicists believe that it should even be a
rule[10].

In a Schrodinger's Cat style experiment, there is a radioactive
particle that might or might not decay. According to rule (1), *both* 
possibilities exist together in a *superposition*. It triggers (or does not) a 
device, which then kills (or does not) a cat. Now the particle, device, and 
cat are *together* in a superposition. As long as the system obeys (1), both 
"branches" of the experiment remain, with more and more objects joining the
superposition as they encounter the experiment.

If we wanted to *experimentally confirm* that such a large macroscopic system 
is in a superposition, it would be nearly impossible. We normally do this via an
interference experiment, but doing that requires careful control of all
particles involved[5]. For most large experiments, this is way beyond our 
reach[4]. This fact is known as *decoherence*. It is a *practical* limitation, 
not a *theoretical* one[1]. Decoherence says it is *hard* to demonstrate the
superposition, not that there *isn't* one.

**This is where most people lose the plot.**

It is very easy to fall prey to sloppy thinking and say "oh, because of 
decoherence, the cat has a well-defined fate, even if we don't know what it is."
But that is *not* what the theory predicts. It says that the cat does *not*
have a well-defined fate, because we can *in principle* still do an interference
experiment and demonstrate it, *even if it's really really hard*. And this 
ought to be true even if your friend has already seen the result (but crucially, 
*you* have not encountered the ever-expanding system).

Now, once *you* see a dead cat, presumably you *are* entitled to say that the 
cat has a well-defined fate. So the question is: when did this fate come into 
being?

There are only two possibilities. Either the state vector "collapsed" somewhere
(i.e., it became impossible *in principle* to do an interference experiment
because there is no longer a superposition),
or else **your encountering the experiment is the *first* moment the cat has a
well-defined fate**. This is logically inescapable[8].

Obviously nobody would like to believe that they are the sole observer in their
reality. Therefore, most physicists throughout history have adopted the
"Copenhagen Interpretation." Roughly, it says "dude, a 'collapse' *must* have 
happened, somewhere, somewhen, somehow, because otherwise WTF." Hence rule (2).
This is good enough for practical purposes, but it doesn't touch the fundamental 
issue.

As the noose has been tightened on the "collapse" hypothesis over the decades,
many have jumped ship to the "Many Worlds Interpretation" (MWI). There are
many different formulations of it, but in essence what it says is: from a
God's-eye perspective of the system, when you encounter the system, you also 
join the superposition. Therefore, properly speaking, the cat *still* does not 
have a well-defined fate when you see it. Instead, there are now two "copies" of 
you (one in each "branch" or "world"), with each one seeing the corresponding 
result.

Crisis averted, right?

**This is where most of the rest seem to lose the plot.**

Consider how things look for "one copy of you" -- henceforth, just "you," since
you conveniently happen to *be* just "one copy of you." Unless you are 
willing to face a decomposing cat and say "nope, not really dead," there 
obviously *is* a meaningful sense in which it has a well-defined fate.

Once you confront this, the natural thing to do is to say "maybe it already
*had* a fate which you just *learned*." But that would be discarding what we 
have taken great pains to establish: *standard QM without collapse insists 
that it did not have one.*

Once you remember *that*, maybe you will scream "decoherence!" and the cycle 
can start afresh[9].

Luckily, there are enough shells in this shell game that you can avoid seeing
this conclusion for as long as you like.

---

To be clear, I'm sure few physicists really like the above conclusion. And yet
if you carefully follow the bread crumbs, it's pretty hard to avoid. The other
possibility is that QM is wrong, but very few physicists believe that[10].

Eugene Wigner was (in)famous for his interpretation that conscious beings
cause collapse[6], but we can see that he perhaps did it to avoid this more 
troubling conclusion (in 1967):

> *This [reduction of the quantum state] takes place whenever the result
  of an observation enters the
  consciousness of the observer - or, to be even more painfully precise,
  my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people
  being only subjects of my observations.*
>
> &nbsp; ...
>
> *However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
  extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
  people, in their hearts, will go along with it.*

It seems we've known this for many decades, but it's obviously very hard to
swallow.

> *While no great philosopher has explicitly espoused solipsism, this can
be attributed to the inconsistency of much philosophical reasoning. Many
philosophers have failed to accept the logical consequences of their own
most fundamental commitments and preconceptions.*

I think you can replace "philosopher" with "physicist" and it
is still true. Luckily, solipsism isn't the only possible answer. There are
other forms of idealism that can work, but we will get to those later.

### Consciousness

There is nothing physicists hate more than people believing that consciousness
is somehow relevant for QM. While this is totally understandable, I'd like to
share why I think this is folly.

As the above reasoning shows, we must treat the system as evolving according
to rule (1) until it "collapses," but we have no reason to believe that it 
really *does* collapse. All we know is that there is an upper bound on when I 
must stop saying that there is no well-defined result: in particular, it can't 
possibly be after "I see the result." If you try to pin down what you *mean*
by those words, you will find yourself trying to make precise what it means to 
experience or become conscious of a result[7].

Why on earth should something as ill-defined as "my consciousness" serve as an 
upper bound on the reality of a cat's fate in "my world" -- as well as an
infinitude of other quantum events going on around me all the time? That's 
obviously nonsense, but until we confront it more honestly, we will continue 
to be perplexed. And I believe that cannot happen until we transcend a very
reasonable [cause of fear](fear.html).

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected
with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that
has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum
mechanics and its applications to the universe.*

> *Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make
sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the
observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely
uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash
with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics,
and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go
away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.*

### Notes and references

1. Roger Penrose (2004), The Road to Reality, pp. 802-803:
> ...the environmental-decoherence viewpoint ... maintains that state 
vector reduction can be understood as coming about because the
environmental system under consideration becomes inextricably entangled
with its environment.[...] We think of the environment as extremely
complicated and essentially 'random' [... but] there is no general 
principle providing an
absolute bar to extracting information from the environment.[...]
Accordingly, such descriptions are referred to as FAPP [For All Practical
Purposes].

   [The decoherence myth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

   > Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

   See also [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/374212/118804).

   It should be noted that some are looking for "(in-principle) irreversible decoherence."
See this[interesting paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3796). Nonetheless, no
such mechanism has been found.

2. If you try to make precise what you mean by "you" and "see" in such a
claim, you will find it *very slippery.* But to try and pin it down here
would make this piece ten times as long. Your friend *telling* you the
result is enough, but the buck still stops with "you."

3. [The most embarrassing graph in modern physics](www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/01/17/the-most-embarrassing-graph-in-modern-physics/).

   The leading interpretation is Copenhagen, which very roughly, is "a collapse
probably happens somewhere, somewhen, somehow."

   > *I think Copenhagen is completely ill-defined, and shouldn’t be the favorite anything of any thoughtful person*

   Otherwise only 9% like objective collapse explanations, and 0% like
De Broglie-Bohm (a leading alternative to QM). All the rest are interpretations
of standard QM, allowing only unitary evolution (i.e., preserving the
superposition).

4. On the other hand, we have done this with at least trillions of 
(well-controlled) particles. See, e.g. [here](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2010/mar/18/quantum-effect-spotted-in-a-visible-object).

5. This accounts for why we don't see an interference pattern in the
two-slit experiment when there is a detector. If we had careful control over
all atoms in the detector, we would see that the particle + detector system is
still in a superposition, and demonstrates a kind of interference. The particle
alone will not demonstrate interference. The math here is relatively basic, but
beyond the scope of this article.

   In this sense, any physical system can serve as a "measuring device," but
only in the sense that it makes demonstrating interference *hard*.

6. See the [Wigner - von Neumann interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretation)
aka "consciousness causes collapse."

7. Note that "seeing the result" can also be indirect. For example, 
light scattering off the ceiling may give indirect evidence of the cat's fate,
and that's as good as seeing the cat itself. On the other hand, there can
be *degrees* of certainty about the fate, depending on how strong your
entanglement with the different outcomes. There's a lot more to say, but this
isn't the place.

8. In this previously linked [Physics Stackexchange answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/374212/118804),
they list three possibilities (collapse, modify QM, or MWI). As we've seen,
MWI doesn't really solve it. This leaves collapse or QM is wrong.

9. See [this SE answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/387852/has-quantum-solipsism-been-addressed-in-the-mwi-literature),
where the sole commenter loses the plot twice. Genuine apologies if he or she
ever reads this; it is not my intention to ridicule. 

   I've also sought
feedback from quantum physicist friends, as well as others 
[online](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/on-being-the-sole-observer-in-mwi.926552/#post-5849579).

10. See [here](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/01/17/the-most-embarrassing-graph-in-modern-physics/). 
In particular, note that 9% believe in "objective collapse." As for Copenhagen, 
it is addressed separately in this piece. And the only option that modifies
the rules of QM is "de Broglie - Bohm", which gets a whopping 0%. "Other" is
sounding like a pretty good option.
