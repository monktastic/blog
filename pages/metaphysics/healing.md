We all know that what we experience is not reality itself, but only our own 
personal projection or coloration of it. Through practices like meditation,
we learn to deeply heal our perspective on reality.

When this healing is profound enough, it sometimes seems as though your healing
"bleeds into" the external world, healing it in the process. Sometimes this
happens to a degree that your worldview has a hard time explaining it.

At such a point you have two choices: mentally *insist* that it's impossible
and must be a coincidence, or else soften the imagined boundary between
"reality itself" and "my experience of reality." Perhaps your experience of
reality *is* reality?

If you do the former, you will limit the degree of healing that is possible.
You will ensure that it never crosses the threshold into making the world more
beautiful in ways that you have difficulty explaining. You fear going crazy, 
and ironically, this fear is precisely what prevents you from healing 
completely. You remain safe in your cocoon, where difficult possibilities
cannot reach.

Alternatively, you open out into the unknown. You find the aspect of mind that
is terrified of releasing its stranglehold on the way it understands reality,
and you allow it to heal. This takes time, but ultimately it is the only way
to heal completely.
