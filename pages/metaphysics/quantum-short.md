## Summary

This is a shortened version of a [much longer document](quantum.html).
It's useful if you already understand QM to some degree, or are just
looking for an overview of the problem (as I see it). It gives special
emphasis to why MWI does not solve the core WTF.

I will be using layman's terminology as much as possible.

### The measurement problem

Sometimes you can do an experiment where there are two possible
outcomes. For example, a particle goes through the left or right slit;
a particle decays or doesn't (killing a cat or not).

QM predicts that "both" outcomes are preserved in a superposition.
It is not that one "really" happened but we don't know which.
Small-scale experiments bear this out. It is practically impossible
to demonstrate this in macroscopic experiments (due to *decoherence*),
but this is a *practical* matter and not a *theoretical* one.

As the experiment encounters more things, those things "join" the
superposition. There are still two branches: one in which the particle
decays and the cat is dead; and one where it didn't and the cat
survives. These branches never interfere, but there are still two.

Yet *I* only ever see *one* result: the cat is *either* dead *or* alive.

This is the essence of the measurement problem: QM predicts *two* but
I see *one*.

One explanation is that "somewhere, somehow, two became one." This is
called "collapse of the wavefunction" and is largely out of style (because
it's not really an explanation but a restatement of the problem). Still,
it is a perfectly fine approximation in most cases.

Another explanation the "many worlds interpretation" (MWI) which points
out that two never really become one; instead, you also join the
superposition and "split in two," and each copy of you sees one answer.
Therefore (some claim), there's nothing to explain.

There are also other exotic possibilities, which I won't cover here.

#### Why MWI does not resolve the central issue

Consider how things look for "one copy" of you (henceforth, just "you,"
since you are *always* just "one copy of you"). Keeping this perspective
is critical. Look out his or her eyes -- as you are right now.

*Before* you encounter the experiment, QM predicts that *there is no
answer yet*. It's not just that you don't know the answer[1].
Decoherence does not help you here; it explains why the two branches
don't interfere, but does not deny that there are still two[2]. If you
think there is one answer, I challenge you to find a *falsifiable*
sense in which this is true.

*After* you see a decomposing cat, you *are* entitled to say, *in some
meaningful sense*, that the cat is dead. Forget about the fact that your
copy sees the other result and so you're not "really" entitled to say
this. *You*, *here*, very much are, in a sense that I challenge you to
deny.

Now ask yourself: *what changed when I saw it?* The answer cannot be
"I gained knowledge of the pre-existing answer," because *there was no
pre-existing answer*.

The "decoherence solves it" and "there are still two answers" arguments
overlook this simple point, presumably because of the giant WTF you
have to own up to otherwise.

### The punchline

If QM is correct, and collapse "interpretations" are wrong, then
in *some meaningful sense*, the truth of the cat's fate comes into
being simultaneously with *your* knowledge (direct or indirect) of it.
And this does not happen when your friends see it.

In *some* sense, you are the sole observer of your world.

That statement probably rubs you the wrong way, since QM is often
misappropriated to support woo-woo. Nonetheless, I encourage you to
reason through it yourself.

Because the conclusion is so distasteful, we hold out hope for
alternate theories like [GRW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghirardi%E2%80%93Rimini%E2%80%93Weber_theory)
or [Bohm's pilot wave theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory).
Even the [von Neumann-Wigner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Wigner_interpretation)
"consciousness causes collapse" theory may look preferable: there, at
least, there are *other* conscious observers.

Who knows, maybe one of the alternative theories will turn out to be
right. Or maybe they're just attempts at avoidance.

#### My own conclusion

As long as I have your attention, I'll share my view. Woo-woo shields,
maximum power!

There really *is* a sense in which this is *your* world. But it is
crucial to understand the precise definition of "you," or else you
really can go crazy via [derealization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization)
or [schizophrenia](http://greengaze.blogspot.com/2009/07/g-everything-is-connected-but-some.html)
by subtly misinterpreting. Your woo-woo shield serves a noble purpose.

The reason that your knowledge of the cat's fate is coincident with
the truth of it is that they are the same thing, described from two
perspectives. Your knowledge of the world *is* the world. If you look
precisely into what your "knowledge" is -- what, exactly, you are
encountering when you witness a dead cat -- you will discover the
luminous fabric of experience, the very stuff of
[consciousness](consciousness.html).

You are not conscious *of* the world; consciousness *is* the world.
It does not come about as the *result* of physical processes; it is that
which (to appropriate the words of Stephen Hawking) "breathes fire into
the equations"; that which makes them "real" in the first place.

You are powerful enough to dream up a reality where you are the apparent
victim of random, uncaring forces, but you are *not* powerful enough
to erase all trace of your power. It had to shine through somewhere,
and QM is one of the cracks through which you can detect it, though you
try to pave over it.

This is closely connected to the Eastern definitions of enlightenment,
which are often accomplished by investigating questions like
["who am I"](https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/teachings/instructions/)
or the dreamlike nature of reality.

Much Western understanding of these traditions stops short, assuming
that one's default metaphysics (such as time and space
being literally real) can remain intact while becoming enlightened.
One clings desperately to this idea: "I may see through my *ideas* of
reality, but since (I'm totally correct and) they're real, they will
continue to function."

But one cannot eat one's cake and have it, too. Until one confronts the
fiendishly clever tricks by which one upholds various certainties about
reality, there is no realization.

Luckily, this a falsifiable hypothesis -- though you probably shouldn't
wait for others to prove it, this being *your* world and all (I know,
convenient, huh?). You can
begin by first [shedding some undeserved certainty](radical-skepticism.html)
and then uncovering the [layers of your mind](layers-of-mind.html).

Or maybe I'm just smoking something, you know?

Bon voyage.

### Notes and references

[1] If you can find a falsifiable sense in which there is only one
answer, I encourage you to do so. It would be a good demonstration of
where QM or MWI is flawed.

Also see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):
```
Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.
