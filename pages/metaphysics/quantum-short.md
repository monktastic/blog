### Summary

In a particular sense, you are the sole observer in your world. (Either that, 
or there's a state vector collapse, or QM is wrong. I don't believe the latter.)

**Caveat**: I am not a physicist. Nonetheless, I can tell you a bit about
positive semidefinite trace class operators on Hilbert space, so I'm not
*entirely* clueless either.

---

It's very hard to do justice to this argument in a short space, but I'm going to 
try.

In a Schrodinger's Cat type experiment, before you become
entangled with the system, it is in a superposition. This should be true even
if your friend has seen it first.

A principle known as *decoherence* is sometimes invoked to explain why the
system is not *really* in a superposition, but this is a misunderstanding. It
only explains why you cannot *exploit* this superposition in practice[1].

This means that the cat does not have a well-defined fate yet, in a
sense that can be physically verified in principle (even if this is nearly 
impossible *in practice*).

Once you *see* a decomposing cat, there clearly *is* a sense in which the cat
has a well-defined fate. This is true even if you subscribe to the "many-worlds
interpretation" (MWI), which points out that from a God's-eye perspective,
*both* fates occurred (with one copy of you inhabiting each corresponding world).

So there is *no* well-defined result -- and this is a physically verifiable
fact, regardless of the practical difficulty in demonstrating it -- before you 
see it. And there *is* a well-defined result after you see it. You, personally
[2]. And it's not just the occasional cat. The whole world is under the domain
of QM.

The only ways around this are if the state vector "collapses" somewhere (i.e.,
the theory predicts that it became *theoretically impossible* to demonstrate
superposition), or if QM is wrong. Neither possibility is liked by the
community[3]. MWI is frequently invoked as another way around the problem, but
regardless of how God sees things, "any copy of you" -- i.e., *you, reading
this* -- are still the only "observer" in your world.

To be clear, I'm sure few physicists really like the above conclusion. And yet
if you carefully follow the footsteps, it's pretty hard to avoid.

Eugene Wigner was (in)famous for his interpretation that conscious beings
cause collapse, but we can see that he did it to avoid a more troubling
conclusion:

> *This [reduction of the quantum state] takes place whenever the result
  of an observation enters the
  consciousness of the observer - or, to be even more painfully precise,
  my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people
  being only subjects of my observations.*
>
> &nbsp; ...
>
> *However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
  extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
  people, in their hearts, will go along with it.*

--- 

> *While no great philosopher has explicitly espoused solipsism, this can
be attributed to the inconsistency of much philosophical reasoning. Many
philosophers have failed to accept the logical consequences of their own
most fundamental commitments and preconceptions.*
>
> &nbsp;
> Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds](http://www.iep.utm.edu/solipsis/)

I think you can replace "philosopher" in that quote with "physicist" and it
is still true.

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected
with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that
has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum
mechanics and its applications to the universe.*

sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the
observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely
uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash
with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics,
and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go
away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions.*

### Notes and references

1. Roger Penrose (2004), The Road to Reality, pp. 802-803:
> ...the environmental-decoherence viewpoint ... maintains that state 
vector reduction can be understood as coming about because the
environmental system under consideration becomes inextricably entangled
with its environment.[...] We think of the environment as extremely
complicated and essentially 'random' [... but] there is no general 
principle providing an
absolute bar to extracting information from the environment.[...]
Accordingly, such descriptions are referred to as FAPP [For All Practical
Purposes].

   [The decoherence myth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

   > Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

2. If you try to make precise what you mean by "you" and "see" in such a
claim, you will find it *very slippery.* But to try and pin it down here
would make this piece ten times as long. Your friend *telling* you the
result is enough, but the buck still stops with "you."

3. [The most embarrassing graph in modern physics](www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/01/17/the-most-embarrassing-graph-in-modern-physics/).

   The leading interpretation is Copenhagen, which very roughly, is "a collapse
probably happens somewhere, somewhen, somehow."

   > *I think Copenhagen is completely ill-defined, and shouldn’t be the favorite anything of any thoughtful person*

   Otherwise only 9% like objective collapse explanations, and 0% like
De Broglie-Bohm (a leading alternative to QM). All the rest are interpretations
of standard QM, allowing only unitary evolution (i.e., preserving the
superposition).
