## Summary

This is a shortened version of a [much longer document](quantum.html).
If you want to understand more details, go there. Let's jump right in.

Many of the founders of QM believed that consciousness was somehow
relevant to the theory[1]. Over the years, there have been various
shifts toward and away from this viewpoint. Today it is a mess, ranging
from New Age thinkers who totally misunderstand[2], to physicists who
pretend there is no real problem.

Instead of using polemic, let's take a look at what we do know.

* Particles can be in "superpositions." An electron can be "spin-up" or
"spin-down" or in some "combination" of those states (though this
wording is not precise).

* If the electron encounters a detector, the detector joins in on the
superposition. Now we have a combination of "electron is spin-up and
detector reads spin-up" and "electron is spin-down and detector reads
spin-down."

* As more particles encounter the system, they join in on the
entanglement.

* As countless trillions of air particles and photons do this, it becomes
basically impossible *in practice* to demonstrate that the system is
really in a superposition. This fact is called "decoherence." But as
far as we know, it still *is* in a superposition. This means that
both possibilities still remain.

* When my friend encounters the system, she joins the superposition, too.

* Once I join the party -- for example, by asking her whether she sees
the result as "spin-up" or "spin-down" -- I only ever get one answer.

* Since there were two outcomes before I encountered the experiment and
only one after, something fishy seems to be going on.

Nobody has adequately explained the "something fishy," but many people
seem to believe they have. Decoherence solves nothing.

Based on what we know about QM today, it is hard to avoid the conclusion
that my "encountering" the system is what
