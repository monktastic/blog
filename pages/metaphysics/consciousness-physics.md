title: Consciousness is not physical

### Summary

Consciousness cannot be physical.

---

This claim is obviously controversial, as evidenced by the fact that pretty 
much no serious scientist believes it[1]. Nonetheless, I think it is an 
inevitable finding. I will present my reasoning.

You can be sure of your own consciousness. You cannot be sure of anyone
else's.
For something to be "physical," it ought to be equally verifiable, in
principle, by anyone with the right tools. It should never be the case that
there's an asymmetry: *I* can be sure of X but *you* cannot. Imagine if 
gravity or the Higgs Boson were verifiable by some people, but *in principle* 
not by others. 

In other words, these three things cannot be true at the same time:

1. I can be sure of my consciousness.
1. You cannot be.
1. It is physical (or fully described by physical processes).

This is why the argument "but science has conquered all other
hard questions we've thrown at it; why not this one?" does not work here. No
other "phenomenon" has this fundamental asymmetry. (Thought as we shall see 
later, even calling it a "phenomenon" is already misleading.)

So which of the above three points is false?
The most obvious candidate for attack is (1). That is why we have quotes
like this:

You might try to deny consciousness outright, or you might find an indirect
route: [emergentism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/), [epiphenomenalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/), etc.

But centuries of philosophical debate have not resolved it, and so it's
pointless for me to take that route. Instead I will say this: your 
intellect is only a subset of your consciousness. It *thinks* it has domain 
over the entire space, but it does not. And it has an *infinitude* of clever 
tricks to avoid seeing this. 

As best I can tell, there is only one way to discover the thing I'm trying
to convey. Sit down and **do** the exercise laid out in the [you can know
that you're conscious](your-consciousness.html) piece. There will be a
subtle battle going on.

> **Intellect**: it can't be....
>
> **The-wisdom-that-underlies-intellect**: but it is.
>
> **Intellect**: but it *can't* be!
>
> **TWTUI**: but it is.
>
> ...

Of course, it may not sound exactly like that in your mind. It may simply feel
like part of you going "So what? There's nothing very special going on here,"
and another part which isn't *quite* so sure yet.

You and I both understand the "nothing special" argument perfectly well. In
our default state, pretty much all intellectual roads lead back to it.
But there *is* something very special going on here. It's just that nobody has
found a way of expressing it clearly to the intellect, so we mostly just end
up with poetry.

1. Except perhaps, again, for this guy:

   > *I think consciousness will remain a mystery. Yes, that's what I tend
to believe. I tend to think that the workings of the conscious brain
will be elucidated to a large extent. Biologists and perhaps physicists
will understand much better how the brain works. But why something that
we call consciousness goes with those workings, I think that will remain
mysterious. I have a much easier time imagining how we understand the
Big Bang than I have imagining how we can understand consciousness.*
