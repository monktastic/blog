Now let us briefly explore another question we raised earlier:

* Whether or not there is an external reality, how much leeway do I have in constructing my private reality? I clearly have some freedom to interpret, but how deep does this freedom go?

Have you ever had the experience of being temporarily free of your
mental baggage? Where you felt unburdened by your past, and as a result,
much more joyful and unconstrained regarding your future?

If you don't feel that way right now, what is stopping you? Isn't it 
because you already have some idea of how the future will go, based on 
how things have gone in the past, and your predicted trajectory 
isn't as beautiful as you'd like?

If you've followed the series this far, you may be unsurprised to
discover that this way of thinking is completely illogical. To
spell it out:

[*There is no logical reason to believe that the laws of reality will
continue to operate in the future as they have in the past.*](future.html)

This will no doubt strike you as absurd. Nonetheless, if you follow
the reasoning very carefully, the conclusion is again inevitable.
Philosophers continue to debate the meaning and consequences of this 
conclusion, but it is well-accepted.

What happens when you are able to loosen your mental stranglehold on 
the way things must operate? When you're not so dead certain that other 
people will act a certain way because they are such-and-such kind of 
person?

At a conventional level, we recognize that the accompanying feeling of 
lightness and joy is actually beneficial. Other people respond better
when we're joyful and forgiving. There's nothing very strange about
that.

What about at a deeper level? It's one thing for your partner to
experience catharsis when you forgive her in person, but a little
stranger if she were to experience it without *knowing* that you 
forgave her. It could still be explained away, of course, but it's a 
little harder.

If what I'm suggesting is true, wouldn't we have evidence of things like
distant healing through prayer? Why have scientific studies mostly
failed on this front?

On the other hand, if this really *is* your dream, wouldn't *you*
have to allow such evidence into the dream?

We've already seen why it's dangerous to permit such evidence when
your egoic structures are so solidly intact. Luckily, radical 
forgiveness is precisely the kind of practice that would simultaneously 
weaken your egoic grip *and* potentially generate the kind of evidence
you'd need to confirm that things are far stranger than you currently 
realize.

It's a two-for-one deal, and luckily, supplies last until you're
[totally awake](www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html).

For some reason, nobody finds it too strange that much of Tibetan
Buddhism comes not from the historical Buddha, but from the
[primordial buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi-Buddha) via
various people's dreams. It might be because we can sense something
profoundly true regardless of provenance.

If there were a modern teaching that came via Dream Jesus, you'd no
doubt find it too laughable to bother reading. So I won't bother
to tell you where this quote is from. Note that the word "thinking"
here does not refer to the coarse conceptualization you normally notice, 
but to the subtle layers of cognition referred to 
[earlier](layers-of-mind.html).

> *The Course's assertion is that everything stems from the mind. The mind's thinking provides the basis for everything that it experiences. Whichever way the mind chooses to look at reality, it will find itself surrounded by and experiencing a "reality" that is the precise mirror of that. The mind's fundamental belief-system first manifests as inner feelings, emotions, interpretations and perceptions; and then manifests as the "outer" reality in which the mind seems to live.*

> *Our healing, then, must be a healing of the mind, a healing of our fundamental perspective on reality. This is what the miracle does. It comes in a moment, a holy instant, when we decide to temporarily suspend our habitual perspective on things. As we momentarily loosen our grip on the ego, our minds are allowed to shift into a new way of seeing things. And since our thinking is the foundation for our entire experience, as our thinking shifts, so does everything else. Our whole experience of life is allowed to brighten from the bottom up, making this kind of healing more deeply liberating than being healed of even the most insidious and destructive physical disease.*
