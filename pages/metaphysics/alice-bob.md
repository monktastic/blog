>*When [Rechungpa] returned to Tibet after many years, his old master
  Milarepa came to welcome him on a barren plateau. After they had exchanged
  greetings and discussed Rechungpa's studies for some time, a violent
  hailstorm suddenly broke from out of the sky. There was nowhere to hide in
  the flat open plain. Milarepa spotted a yak horn on the ground and quickly
  took refuge inside of it -- without the horn becoming larger or Milarepa
  becoming smaller. From his dry shelter, Milarepa sang a song letting
  Rechungpa know that there was still plenty of space in the yak horn... if
  only his student had realized the nature of emptiness.*

>*You might think that the story of Milarepa's yak horn is merely a fairy
  tale. Or, if you are the credulous type, you might believe that it was a
  case of sorcery performed by the Tibetan yogi. But it is neither, as we
  will see.*

### Act 1: The Fairground

Alice and Bob are walking through an art fair. They stop to appreciate
the brilliance of a piece. Is it two giraffes or an elephant?

<img src="giraffe-elephant.gif" width="300" height="300" align="middle"
style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

**Alice**: It depends on which way you look at it.

**Bob**: Right. In some sense it is both, and in another sense, neither.

**Alice**: In a way, it's similar to reality. What reality *is* depends on
how you *perceive* it.

**Bob**: That's true. On the other hand, there's a limit. Just as with
the sculpture, you can choose to *see* the world in different ways, but
ultimately the underlying reality restricts how you can *interact* with
it.

**Alice**: Are you *sure* of that?

**Bob**: *[Spits out coffee]* What? Explain yourself.

**Alice**: Well, what if the sculpture analogy ultimately breaks down? What if
your perspective on reality *is* reality? What if there were a way to
"rotate" reality -- or *through* reality, if you like -- in such a way
that *seeing* an elephant allowed you to *interact* with the elephant?

**Bob**: In other words, what if by changing our perspective on reality,
we could change reality itself? In an *objectively verifiable* way?

**Alice**: That's the general idea, yes.

**Bob**: Then all of science would be disproved, and obviously that
hasn't happened, so... [QED, bitches](https://xkcd.com/622/)!

**Alice**: Haha, you got me, old chap!

*Bob pulls out a pipe to celebrate.*

### Act two: Mind control

**Alice**: On the other hand, might it just be that your current
perspective doesn't allow for such possibilities, and *that* explains
why you don't see it happening?

**Bob**: Hmm. That *is* internally consistent. On the other hand, let me
test it out. "I hereby believe that reality can be shifted at will. I
also believe that I have a million dollars in the bank."

*Bob pulls out his phone to demonstrate his woeful bank balance.*

**Alice**: You really ought to contribute to a 401(k), Bob. But why do
you think that demonstrates anything? Do you really have complete
command over your mind?

**Bob**: If you'll recall, I do have a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from
Harvard. So yeah, I'd say I have a pretty good command.

**Alice**: I don't mean that kind of command. I mean for example, when
you're reading a book, do you ever suddenly discover that your eyes
have been scanning the page while your mind has been wandering?

**Bob**: Of course. Doesn't that happen to everyone?

**Alice**: Everyone except moderately trained meditators, yes. In that
zoned-out phase, are you conscious or unconscious of your thoughts?

**Bob**: Hmm... I'd say it's a hybrid. On one hand, I don't *know* that
I'm wandering, so kind of unconscious. On the other hand, if you ask me
what I'm thinking about, I can tell you, so kind of conscious.

**Alice**: Exactly. Have you noticed that virtually your entire day is
spent in this semi-conscious haze?

**Bob**: That's absurd. I would definitely notice that.

**Alice**: Just like you definitely notice yourself reading mindlessly?
In your daily life you may become present for a fraction of a second
every few minutes, but then your mind goes right back to zombie mode,
and back-fills a just-so story making you *believe* that you've been
present.

**Bob**: How can I test this out for myself?

**Alice**: Sit in a quiet place and pay attention to your breath. Every
time you notice your mind wandering, gently release the thoughts and
return to the breath.

**Bob**: You're just trying to get me to meditate!

**Alice**: Guilty as charged!

**Bob**: Fine, I'll take you up on this challenge.

*Bob ships off to a monastery to meditate for three months.*

### Act 3: Layers of mind

**Bob**: Wow, that was remarkable.

**Alice**: What did you learn?

**Bob**: At first, it seemed easy to pay attention to the breath. Then, after
some days of nonstop practice, I noticed that my attention seemed to
be getting *worse*. I was being interrupted by thoughts all the time!

**Alice**: Why would your attention become worse by meditating?

**Bob**: Turns out it didn't. I merely began *noticing* how busy my mind had
always been. Once that layer of nonstop internal monologue calmed down
after some weeks, I discovered there were more layers beneath!

**Alice**: Such as?

**Bob**: Subtle thoughts about how I was feeling. I understand so much more
about myself -- about my mood and personality, for example -- than I
could ever have hoped to before. And now that I see that we're *all*
neurotic in this way, it's *so much easier* to be kind.

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle*
> -- Philo of Alexandria

**Alice**: That sounds wonderful! So, are you done? Have you attained
enlightenment?

**Bob**: I don't know. I am able to sit in a very peaceful state, with my
mind lucid and unmoving. Does that count?

**Alice**: So it still feels like you are an individual located in space and
time doing something called "meditation."

**Bob**: Of course, why wouldn't it?

**Alice**: You are far from done. You have not even penetrated the layer of
mind that gives rise to the illusion of physical reality.

**Bob**: I don't like where you are going with this. What do you mean
"the illusion of?"

**Alice**: Let me ask you: *why* do you believe in time?

*Bob becomes pensive.*

### Act 4: The illusion of time

**Bob**: I think I know how you'll respond to most of these, but I'll
play along. This picture we took yesterday is evidence of the past.

**Alice**: What if reality actually just sprang into being *now*, fully
formed, with that picture (and your memory) as convincing artifacts?

**Bob**: This sounds like the young earth creationist Omphalos
Hypothesis, which says that God planted dinosaur bones as a test of
our faith. But I admit, there's no way to disprove it.

**Alice**: Is there any reason to think it's *unlikely?*

**Bob**: Of course. Universes don't just spring into being from nothing.
That would violate the laws of physics.

**Alice**: Doesn't your knowledge of the physics presuppose the past?
Reality just sprang into being *now*. Your memory of those laws -- and
of getting your Ph.D. -- are illusions.

**Bob**: Right, it's circular. On the other hand, Occam's Razor suggests
that the simplest possibility is usually correct. Since time is the
simplest explanation, we should choose it.

**Alice**: How do you justify Occam's Razor?

**Bob**: Well it has a long history of... oh, I see. Well, I can still
use it as a guiding principle. Simpler theories are more beautiful.

**Alice**: But then aren't you just stating a *preference*, and not a
logical justification?

**Bob**: It's more than just *preference!* We should believe in time
because that belief *works.*

**Alice**: And how do you *know* that it works?

**Bob**: It's been working since time sprang into being a minute ago,
hasn't it?

**Alice**: A minute ago? Reality just sprang into being... *now*.

**Bob**: I'm feeling rather annoyed, but everything you say is logically 
unimpeachable. I understand now that there's no *reason* to believe in
time, but I find that I cannot help myself.

**Alice**: What do you think accounts for this difficulty?

**Bob**: Well if time is real, then it would be evolutionarily
advantageous to believe in it, and so my reptilian brain is hard-wired
that way. Hmm, that's also circular. I think I'm beginning to see a
pattern.

**Alice**: Wonderful. You are now at a decision point. On one hand, you
can sweep this all under the rug.
