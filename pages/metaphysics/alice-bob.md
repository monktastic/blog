  Milarepa came to welcome him on a barren plateau. After they had exchanged
  greetings and discussed Rechungpa's studies for some time, a violent
  hailstorm suddenly broke from out of the sky. There was nowhere to hide in
  the flat open plain. Milarepa spotted a yak horn on the ground and quickly
  took refuge inside of it -- without the horn becoming larger or Milarepa
  becoming smaller. From his dry shelter, Milarepa sang a song letting
  Rechungpa know that there was still plenty of space in the yak horn... if

### Act 1: The Fairground

Alice and Bob are walking through an art fair. They stop to appreciate
the brilliance of an art piece. Is it two giraffes or an elephant?

**Alice**: It depends on which way you look at it.

**Bob**: Right. In some sense it is both, and in another sense, neither.

**Alice**: In a way, it's similar to reality. What reality *is* depends
on how you *perceive* it.

**Bob**: Of course, there's a limit. Just as with the sculpture, you can
choose to *see* the world in different ways, but ultimately the
underlying reality restricts how you can *interact* with it.

**Alice**: Are you *sure* of that?

**Bob**: *[Spits out coffee]* What? Explain yourself.

**Alice**: Well, what if the sculpture analogy ultimately breaks down?
What if your perspective on reality *is* reality? What if there were a
way to "rotate" reality -- or rotate yourself *through* reality, if you
prefer -- in such a way that *seeing* an elephant allowed you to
*interact* with it?

**Bob**: In other words, what if by changing our perspective on reality,
we could change reality itself? In an *objectively verifiable* way?

**Alice**: That's the general idea, yes.

**Bob**: Then all of science would be disproved, and obviously that
hasn't happened, so... [QED, bitches](https://xkcd.com/622/)!

**Alice**: Haha, you got me, old chap!

*Bob pulls out a pipe to celebrate.*

---

### Act 2: Mind control

**Alice**: On the other hand, might it just be that your current
perspective doesn't allow for such possibilities, and *that* explains
why you don't see it happening?

**Bob**: Hmm. That *is* internally consistent. On the other hand, let me
test it out. "I hereby believe that reality can be shifted at will. I
also believe that I have a million dollars in the bank."

*Bob pulls out his phone to demonstrate his woeful bank balance.*

**Alice**: You really ought to contribute to a 401(k), Bob. But why do
you think that demonstrates anything? Do you really have complete
command over your mind?

**Bob**: If you'll recall, I do have a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from
Harvard. So yeah, I'd say I have a pretty good command.

**Alice**: I don't mean that kind of command. I mean for example, when
you're reading a book, do you ever suddenly discover that your eyes
have been scanning the page while your mind has been wandering?

**Bob**: Of course. Doesn't that happen to everyone?

**Alice**: Everyone except moderately trained meditators, yes. In that
zoned-out phase, are you conscious or unconscious of your thoughts?

**Bob**: Hmm... I'd say it's a hybrid. On one hand, I don't *know* that
I'm wandering, so kind of unconscious. On the other hand, if you ask me
what I'm thinking about, I can tell you, so kind of conscious.

**Alice**: Exactly. Have you noticed that virtually your entire day is
spent in this semi-conscious haze?

**Bob**: That's absurd. I would definitely notice that.

**Alice**: Just like you definitely notice yourself reading mindlessly?
In your daily life you may become present for a fraction of a second
every few minutes, but then your mind goes right back to zombie mode,
and back-fills a just-so story making you *believe* that you've been
present.

**Bob**: How can I test this out for myself?

**Alice**: Sit in a quiet place and pay attention to your breath. Every
time you notice your mind wandering, gently release the thoughts and
return to the breath.

**Bob**: You're just trying to get me to meditate!

**Alice**: Guilty as charged!

**Bob**: Fine, I'll take you up on this challenge.

*Bob ships off to a monastery to meditate for three months.*

---

### Act 3: Layers of mind

**Bob**: Wow, that was remarkable.

**Alice**: What did you learn?

**Bob**: At first, it seemed easy to pay attention to the breath. Then, after
some days of nonstop practice, I noticed that my attention seemed to
be getting *worse*. I was being interrupted by thoughts all the time!

**Alice**: Why would your attention become worse by meditating?

**Bob**: Turns out it didn't. I merely began *noticing* how busy my mind had
always been. Once that layer of nonstop internal monologue calmed down
after some weeks, I discovered there were more layers beneath!

**Alice**: Such as?

**Bob**: Subtle thoughts about how I was feeling. I understand so much more
about myself -- about my mood and personality, for example -- than I
could ever have hoped to before. And now that I see that we're *all*
neurotic in this way, it's *so much easier* to be kind.

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle*
> -- Philo of Alexandria

**Alice**: That sounds wonderful! So, are you done? Have you attained
enlightenment?

**Bob**: I don't know. I am able to sit in a very peaceful state, with my
mind lucid and unmoving. Does that count?

**Alice**: So it still feels like you are an individual located in space and
time doing something called "meditation."

**Bob**: Of course, why wouldn't it?

**Alice**: You are far from done. You have not even penetrated the layer of
mind that gives rise to the illusion of physical reality.

**Bob**: I don't like where you are going with this. What do you mean
"the illusion of?"

**Alice**: Let me ask you: *why* do you believe in time?

*Bob becomes pensive.*

---

### Act 4: The illusion of time

**Bob**: I think I know how you'll respond to most of these, but I'll
play along. This picture we took yesterday is evidence of the past.

**Alice**: What if reality actually just sprang into being *now*, fully
formed, with that picture (and your memory) as convincing artifacts?

**Bob**: This sounds like the young earth creationist Omphalos
Hypothesis, which says that God planted dinosaur bones as a test of
our faith. But I admit, there's no way to disprove it.

**Alice**: Is there any reason to think it's *unlikely?*

**Bob**: Of course. Universes don't just spring into being from nothing.
That would violate the laws of physics.

**Alice**: Doesn't that presuppose that everything you know is true?
When did you get your physics degree if reality popped into being *now*?

**Bob**: Right, it's circular. On the other hand, Occam's Razor suggests
that the simplest possibility is usually correct. Since time is the
simplest explanation, we should choose it.

**Alice**: How do you justify Occam's Razor?

**Bob**: Well it has a long history of... oh, I see. Well, I can still
use it as a guiding principle. Simpler theories are more beautiful.

**Alice**: But then aren't you just stating a *preference*, and not a
logical justification?

**Bob**: It's more than just *preference!* We should believe in time
because that belief *works.*

**Alice**: And how do you *know* that it works?

**Bob**: It's been working since time sprang into being a minute ago,
hasn't it?

**Alice**: A minute ago? But reality just sprang into being... *now*.

**Bob**: I'm feeling rather annoyed, but everything you say is logically 
unimpeachable. I understand now that there's no *reason* to believe in
time, but I find that I cannot help myself.

**Alice**: What do you think accounts for this difficulty?

**Bob**: Well if time is real, then it would be evolutionarily
advantageous to believe in it, and so my reptilian brain is hard-wired
that way. Hmm, that's also circular. I think I'm beginning to see a
pattern.

**Alice**: Wonderful. You are now at a decision point. On one hand, you
can sweep this all under the rug: *"there's probably a perfectly good
explanation for all this."* On the other, you could choose to penetrate
the fiendishly clever trap in which the mind has ensnared itself. And it
doesn't even require a multi-month retreat. If you're sincere, you can
get a tiny glimpse by staring squarely into the face of what you have
begun to unearth: *It is not "unlikely" that the past is an illusion.*

**Bob**: Seriously? Isn't this red pill / blue pill analogy a little
stereotypical?

**Alice**: Whatever. I've always wanted to use it. Anyway, take this
understanding deep into your heart until you feel the ground being
pulled out from under your feet. This is how you will know you are
ready to continue. If you still feel nothing more than a "so what?",
perhaps now is not the time to be woken up.

### Interlude

**Bob**: Okay, I may have gotten a taste of the vertiginous feeling
you described. But it also brought with it something... refreshing.

**Alice**: Indeed. Your life feels mundane precisely because of your
death grip on a belief that has no basis: that there's nothing
particularly special about *this* moment, since you had one just like
it a moment ago, and a moment before that, etc. Genuine appreciation
is impossible while you cling to time.

**Bob**: Is this just another trick to get me to be mindful?

**Alice**: No. If anything, mindfulness is a trick to get you to go beyond it.

**Bob**: Hmm, I'll have to chew on that....

### Act 5: Quantum woo

> *The Buddha said to Subhuti, “All great bodhisattvas should subdue
their minds in the following manner: they should realize as they vow
to save all sentient beings that in truth there are no sentient beings
to be saved ..."*
>
> &nbsp;
>
> -- The Diamond Sutra

**Bob**: The experiment with time reminded me of something that always
bothered me about quantum physics.

**Alice**: Oh, no. Not this quantum woo-woo stuff!

**Bob**: No! You know I'm not that type. Despite over a hundred years of
arguing, the community doesn't agree on a formulation or interpretation.
I doubt we'll settle it here. But something occurred to me about *why*
it's so hard to agree. If you follow only orthodox, well-established
rules, you end up in a funny place.

**Alice**: Are you including
[wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)
as one of those rules?

**Bob**: Oh, no. That postulate exists to avoid the conclusion I'm about to
show you.

As you well know, under the usual unitary evolution rules,
Schrodinger's Cat is in a *superposition* before you see it. You cannot
say "the cat is *either* dead or alive"; both possibilities still exist.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/215aSTX.jpg" width="350" align="middle"
style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>


**Alice**: How do we *know* they both exist? Why can't we say it's just one
or the other? I know with a single particle, we can do something called
an interference experiment[1]. I thought that was impossible for
cat-sized objects.

**Bob**: The relatively recent theory of *decoherence* explains why it is
very, very hard *in practice* for large objects, but it in no way
denies that they are there *in principle*. This is a common
misconception[2]. Though we are a far cry from a cat, we *have*
done such experiments on macroscopic objects[3], and see no fundamental
limits yet.

Now, what about *after* you encounter the cat? Tell me, if you
encountered a decomposing cat, would you feel comfortable saying that
it is, in fact, dead?

**Alice**: I don't know if "comfortable" is the right word, but of
course I would. Who wouldn't?

**Bob**: Okay. Now tell me, what changed in the moment you encountered
the cat? What enables you to say it has a well-defined fate now, when
you couldn't before?

**Alice**: Because I didn't know the real answer yet?

**Bob**: Come on, you're smarter than that. We *just* said that *there
was no answer yet.*

**Alice**: Maybe there was an answer! What if my friend saw it first?
She would know the real answer.

**Bob**: Yes, Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner tried doing this, too. It is
weird to think of a live human as being in a superposition, so maybe
conscious creatures collapse the wave function[4]. Let's not devolve
into such woo here. If the cat is dead, your friend sees that; if it is
alive, she sees that; both possibilities are still in superposition.

**Alice**: Ah, well if my friend can "split" then so can I. How about
this: the universe splits in two, with one "copy" of me seeing one
result, and the other "copy" seeing the other.

**Bob**: Yes, that's called the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation)
(MWI), but it doesn't solve anything[5]. For any "copy of you" -- henceforth, just
"you" -- the cat's fate is not decided until *you* encounter it (either
directly or indirectly). Somehow the *truth* comes into being simultaneously
with your *knowledge* of it.

**Alice**: *[Smiling knowingly]* That's absurd!

**Bob**: I have a feeling you know more than you're letting on, Alice.
But it gets worse: even if the cat *has been dead* for some time, it
wasn't true a moment ago. The *history* of the cat comes into being
simultaneously with your knowledge of it.

**Alice**: And what exactly do you mean by "you" and "knowledge" or
"encounter" here?

**Bob**: Yes, that is tricky too. If my *toe* encounters it, but that signal
has not reached "me" yet, then the cat's fate *still* hasn't been
settled. So what, precisely, is this "I"? I don't know.

**Alice**: So what does this all tell you?

**Bob**: Well, being a physicist, I'd obviously prefer that one of the many
alternative theories pans out. It's hard to do science when you're the
only observer in the world. Nonetheless, I'm currently more interested
in what the above possibility suggests.

**Alice**: And what does it suggest?

**Bob**: Well, when I confront it very squarely -- like you made me do for
the "time as an illusion" idea -- I end up in a remarkably similar
space as before. My worldview briefly crumbles.

for example.

[2] [The decoherence myth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a
complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of
the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of
physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8)
alike.

[4] See the [Wigner - von Neumann interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretation)
aka "consciousness causes collapse."

However, there's good reason to believe that he championed this idea
to avoid an even uglier possibility:

> This takes place whenever the result of an observation enters the
  consciousness of the observer - or, to be even more painfully precise,
  my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people
  being only subjects of my observations.

...

> However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
  extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
  people, in their hearts, will go along with it.

[5] A common refrain seems to be that, since *both* worlds exist, we
*still* can't say whether the cat is "really" alive or dead. Therefore
nothing special happened when you encountered it. This is true from
a "God's-eye" perspective but irrelevant from yours.
