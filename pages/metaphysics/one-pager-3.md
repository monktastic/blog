### Rationalist spirituality

I'm going to share a number of ways of looking at the world. It is
not important that you *agree* with them, but if this series is to be
of any use to you, it is important that you look very carefully
at where they are pointing.

[Radical skepticism](radical-skepticism.html)

Based on evidence and logic alone, you have no reason to believe in
the existence of time. You cannot even say it is "likely" that
time exists, without making assumptions that themselves depend on time
being real. Belief in time is not *rational*, but *emotional*.

Try and see what happens if you take **completely seriously** the
possibility that *the past never happened.* Look right now at your past
and say "none of this actually happened." Remember that as far as you
can possibly know, it's *actually true*. Do this until you actually
*see* it.

If you merely *understand* it, it will feel like "so what?" If you
genuinely *see* it, it will feel like a brief, poignant, "oh, sh*t."
Don't give up until you have the latter experience.

What would happen if that brief moment lasted much longer (so to speak)?
You almost certainly believe that nothing would change about reality
itself, since the past exists whether or not you believe in it. But have
you actually tested this out? Have you really penetrated the deep layers
of mind that give rise to your beliefs?

Maybe you think you don't need to test it personally, since there would
be evidence "out there" if it really were true. But how much sense does
this make? "If this really *is* my dream, then I will wait for someone
else to prove it!"

If this is your dream, what could allow the relevant evidence to
manifest other than your own sincere investigation? What is convincing
you that this idea is nonsense other than pure circular reasoning?

It is an empirically testable claim, and you're the only scientist
who can conduct the necessary experiments.

[Quantum mechanics](quantum-short.html)

Nobody can quite agree on the correct formulation or interpretation of
QM, despite over a hundred years of trying. Why? Well, let me show you
what can happen if you follow the standard rules faithfully all the
way to the end. I suspect you won't like it very much either.

In the Schrodinger's Cat experiment, the cat would still be in a
superposition of dead and alive before you encounter it (either directly
or indirectly via other particles that have come into contact with the
apparatus). The cat's fate is not determined yet, and in theory
there is an experiment that would demonstrate this[1]. This should be
true *even if your friend has seen the cat.*

This may already seem a little strange, but let's see what happens when
*you* see the cat.

Once you encounter a decomposing cat, there is clearly a meaningful
sense in which you can say "this cat is *dead*." But there *wasn't*
a moment ago. What changed in that moment? It can't be just your
*knowledge* of the "real answer," since there wasn't one. In some funny
sense, the *truth* of the cat's fate came into existence simultaneously
with your (direct or indirect) *knowledge* of it. Not just that, but
at that point the cat *has been dead* for some time, even though that
wasn't true a moment ago.

Can you see how this would be hard to swallow? Why we would be
desperately hoping for some other explanation? Pretty much *any*
explanation is preferable to the possibility that reality (and a
matching history) comes into being when you, personally, encounter it.

Maybe some alternative theory will pan out. But, like in the
previous exercise, see what happens if you confront the above
possibility very squarely: your experience of the world *is* its
reality. And "history" is a story concocted to make sense of your present
reality.

Do you see how it points to the same place as before?

[1] This is normally done via an *interference experiment.* Our limited
technology doesn't permit us to demonstrate it at such a macroscopic
scale, but we've done it with at least tens of thousands of atoms, and
see no fundamental limit.

This practical difficulty is due to something called "decoherence," but
(as far as we know) this is only a practical limitation, not a
theoretical one.

[2] Sometimes people try to argue that the "many worlds interpretation"
solves this, since there are *still* two answers once you see it (with
one copy of you in each "world" seeing one result). But this doesn't
make things any better: *each copy of you* experiences being the "sole
observer" of her world.

More commonly, we just pretend that something called "collapse" happens
somewhere, though nobody knows how or why such a thing would happen,
nor is there any particularly good experimental evidence for it.

1. Logic (time is pure preference)
2. Empiricism (love and consciousness)

The world goes the way you intend.

How does this make you feel?

* It doesn't matter how I *feel* dammit, what matters is the real truth
out there.

Excellent. Now review why you have *no reason* to believe in such a
thing. How does that make you feel?

Your belief in time is based entirely on circular reasoning. As such,
it has **no** justification other than "it feels good." Yet, you feel
powerfully compelled to see it as Truth.

Why? What compels you to believe in space, time, and brains? Try to
answer without reference to those things.

[Layers of mind](layers-of-mind.html)

Deep layers of your mind (not your "brain," mind you) are responsible
for turning a belief in time into the *experience* of time, which is
taken as evidence for the belief. This powerful feedback loop explains
both the compulsion to believe and the repeated attempt to use circular
reasoning to justify it.

We discover that materialism is not *false*; it is true *because you
make it true*.

[Consciousness](consciousness.html)

Consciousness is the potential that manifests as beliefs, thoughts, and
the experiences that you lump together as "reality." Whether or not this
is true in an ultimate sense, it is a valuable insight to experience.
One comes to see more deeply the structure of belief and experience.

The knot of materiality loosens further.

[QM and the measurement problem](quantum.html)

We discover that the foundational question of quantum mechanics is
not so much "solved" as "swept under the rug" in modern treatments.
When reasoned carefully, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that *you*
are the sole observer in your universe.
