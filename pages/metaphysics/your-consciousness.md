title: You are conscious
description:
---

### Summary

You can be certain that you are conscious, in a way that you cannot be certain
of anything else.

---

I am not sure the best way to communicate this insight through writing, but I
will try anyway, through part of a dialogue I once wrote.

---

**Alice**: Can you be sure that you are conscious?

**Bob**: Hmm. No, I could be a simulation, too.

**Alice**: Let me try another way. Doesn't it seem to you like *something is
happening?* Sights, sounds, smells, thoughts, emotions, etc.?

**Bob**: Yes, but those could all be illusions, too.

**Alice**: I'm not asking what they *are.* I'm asking: doesn't it damn sure
***seem** like something is happening?*

**Bob**: I guess, yes.

**Alice**: Guessing isn't good enough.

**Bob**: Well maybe "seeming" is an illusion, too....

**Alice**: Drop the philosophy for now. Don't try to dissect my words.
Just look, and answer as simply as possible: doesn't it seem like something is
happening?

**Bob**: Yes.

**Alice**: Yes like *maybe* yes, or like *definitely* yes?

**Bob**: [*Pauses, closes eyes, and listens...*] Okay, I'm with you. Definitely 
yes.

**Alice**: Awesome.

Forget Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" nonsense. Thinking has nothing to
do with it, and the idea of a self has nothing to do with it.

This "sheer fact
of seeming" is the one thing it is meaningless to doubt. Now, if you
don't actually *do* the exercise of looking, and instead
let your *intellect* run off with the question, it will come up with
all sorts of clever reasons to doubt it. That's a great way to win an
argument or get a philosophy Ph.D., but useless for waking up.

Despite this being literally the only thing to see, somehow you continually
overlook it. When you *do* look, you immediately experience a brief
return to a glorious place you never left. This is a small form of
awakening.

**Bob**: I admit it's lovely. I think I will explore it further.

In truth, you cannot even say "I am conscious." All
you can say is "there is consciousness, the sheer fact of seeming" (and "my 
perspective" is the form it presently seems to be taking). But we will leave 
aside this detail for now.
