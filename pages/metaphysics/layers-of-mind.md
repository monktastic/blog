## Layers of thought: a whirlwind tour of meditation

Have you ever had the experience of reading a book, only to discover that your
eyes are still scanning the page but your mind is elsewhere? If you're
interrupted mid-reverie, chances are you can recall the past few seconds of
thought. Those thoughts were not really *outside* of consciousness and yet,
somehow, you weren't really *noticing* them.

You very likely spend the vast majority of your day in such a state.
You may even have a hard time believing this, since the mind is quick
to back-fill a sense of presence even when there was none. When you
begin to meditate, you see for yourself just how busy your mind is,
in a way that normally escapes your notice. *Most* of your thoughts
are in this "conscious but not noticed" limbo.

Once you learn to notice them, a lot of your mood and
personality can be understood on a level that is simply not possible
otherwise. This accounts for the commonly recognized benefits of
meditation.

If you decide to progress on the path of meditation, this
distraction-without-knowing-it starts happening less and less. As you become
more present, you begin to detect an undercurrent of more subtle thoughts
flowing between the big, coarse ones. When even these quieten, and you're
sitting in a seemingly thought-free state, you might consider yourself basically
free of thought.

But are you really?

If you still feel like a self sitting in a world of space and time, it's because
there's still a layer of your mind you have not yet penetrated.

This is where most meditators stop.

If you look carefully enough, you will notice that your mind is subtly but
continually weaving a worldview from your experiences. Sensations must imply
objects. Memory implies a past; anticipation implies a future; together they
imply time and a self. Etc. The sense that the past contained a physical world
bolsters the certainty that this moment must, too, and that there will be
similar moments to come, following a fairly predictable trajectory. This
narrative becomes the "background" of your experience -- feeling as though it
has been given to you or is happening to you, rather than you actively
fabricating it.

But you *are* fabricating it. It's just that you do it in such a subtle way that
your construction appears as tangible, palpable, externally imposed structures:
like a world *out there*. This seeming externality further cements your confidence
in using it as evidence. Isn't it *viscerally obvious* that time and space are
real, and not merely assumptions? That viscerality isn't happening *to* you; you
are *creating* it. You treat this conclusion as evidence for itself, creating
a closed feedback loop.

You believe it, so you experience it, so you believe it more, so you
experience it more.... And *exactly* like a dream, this self-reinforcing
loop gives rise to the palpable sense of an external reality.

In a remarkable twist, you discover that your metaphysics is not
*false,* per se: rather, *it is true because you make it so*.

This allows you to blame the whole thing on factors outside your control.
"This universe has been here for a long time, and is the reason I feel this way."
Any direction you care to look, you find evidence that this isn't just a
story, but the Truth.

All the mind needs is a seed around which to spin a story, and
it will do all the rest of the work in entrenching it, fleshing out the details,
and sealing off the exits. Your current story is called "physical reality."
