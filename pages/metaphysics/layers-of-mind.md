title: Layers of mind
description:
---

Have you ever had the experience of reading a book, only to discover that your
eyes are still scanning the page but your mind is elsewhere? If you're
interrupted mid-reverie, chances are you can recall the past few seconds of
thought. Those thoughts were not really *outside* of consciousness and yet,
somehow, you weren't really *noticing* them either.

You very likely spend the vast majority of your day in such a semi-conscious 
state. You may have a hard time believing this, because the mind readily
back-fills a sense of presence even when there was none. It's a little bit
like your visual blind spot: to find it, you have to know how to look.

When you begin to meditate, you see for yourself just how busy your mind is,
in a way that normally escapes your notice. You discover that *most* of your 
thoughts occupy this "conscious but not noticed" limbo.

Once you learn to notice this raging river of thoughts, a lot of your mood and
personality can be understood on a level that is simply not possible otherwise. 
This accounts for the commonly recognized benefits of meditation.

If you decide to progress on the path, this distraction-without-knowing-it 
starts happening less and less. As you become more present, you begin to 
detect an undercurrent of ever more subtle thoughts
flowing between the big, coarse ones. When even these quieten, and you're
sitting in a seemingly thought-free state, you might consider yourself basically
free of thought.

But are you really?

If you still feel like a self sitting in a world of space and time, it's because
there's still a layer of your mind you have not yet penetrated.

This is where most meditators stop.

If you look *very carefully*, you will discover that you never actually
experience the passage of time.
You only ever experience a single moment. Woven into this moment is a bit of
experience that you *infer* to be "the past." This inference normally happens 
well beneath the conscious threshold, but it can be made fully conscious.

You *believe* in time because it feels very powerfully like you are 
*experiencing* time. But it only *feels* that way because this
inference is happening well beneath your conscious threshold. For this reason
you assume that the feeling of time passing is happening *to* you, rather than 
you actively *doing* it. But you *are* doing it -- whether or not you're yet 
aware of it.

I cannot convince you of this, and even if 
I could, the intellectual understanding would do you very little good.

Time is not the only inference you are making. When you hear a sound, that
sound is occurring *inside* your mind. Experientially, it happens in exactly the
same place it would if this were a nighttime dream. But you *infer* it to be
coming from outside your mind, and so it *feels* like the sound is happening
outside your mind, "over there." Again, it only feels like this because your
attention isn't precise enough to catch the trick.

In reality, all you ever experience is your own mind. Through a rapid series
of subconscious inferences, you project that experience out and think of it as
"the world out there."

You (seemingly) experience an objective reality because of a series of 
inferences. And you strengthen those inferences because you (seemingly) 
experience an objective reality.

What happens when you stop making those
inferences? As we've already explored, they're not logical to begin with.
Surely there's no danger in letting go of irrational beliefs?

At this point you must be wondering: "couldn't it be the case that there
really *is* a world out there, which is causing the whole process you describe?"

Instead of answering directly, let's look at some related questions:

* Whether or not there is an external reality, how much leeway do I have in
constructing my private reality? I clearly have some freedom to interpret it, 
but how deep does this freedom go?

* The more freedom I discover, the fewer external constraints there must be.
If I had *infinite* freedom, this would demolish my belief in an external 
reality. That's terrifying. Am I artificially limiting my freedom so as not
to rock the boat too much?

* Is there any *physical* evidence that "my reality" and "the world out there" 
are not two separate things? What would such evidence even look like?

In truth, your belief in an external reality is generated in the same way as 
your belief in time: you can't help but believe that it's logical, even though 
the real causes are profoundly emotional.

In most polite presentations of Buddhism, they tend to tread very lightly here.
Nonetheless, if you read between the lines, you will discover what they are
really trying to say.

For now let us turn our attention to the very reasonable concern of *fear*.
