title: Layers of mind
description:
---

Have you ever had the experience of reading a book, only to discover that your
eyes are still scanning the page but your mind is elsewhere? If you're
interrupted mid-reverie, chances are you can recall the past few seconds of
thought. Those thoughts were not really *outside* of consciousness and yet,
somehow, you weren't really *noticing* them either.

You very likely spend the vast majority of your day in such a semi-conscious 
state. You may have a hard time believing this, because the mind readily
back-fills a sense of presence even when there was none. It's a little bit
like your visual blind spot.

When you begin to meditate, you see for yourself just how busy your mind is,
in a way that normally escapes your notice. You discover that *most* of your 
thoughts occupy this "conscious but not noticed" limbo.

Once you learn to notice this raging river of thoughts, a lot of your mood and
personality can be understood on a level that is simply not possible otherwise. 
This accounts for the commonly recognized benefits of meditation.

If you decide to progress on the path, this distraction-without-knowing-it 
starts happening less and less. As you become more present, you begin to 
detect an undercurrent of more subtle thoughts
flowing between the big, coarse ones. When even these quieten, and you're
sitting in a seemingly thought-free state, you might consider yourself basically
free of thought.

But are you really?

If you still feel like a self sitting in a world of space and time, it's because
there's still a layer of your mind you have not yet penetrated.

This is where most meditators stop.

If you look carefully enough, you will notice that your mind is subtly but
continually interweaving your metaphysical beliefs and experience of the world.

You assume that sensations must imply objects. There's a flicker of sensation, 
and you identify it as "foot." Your worldview informs you that it must be "*my* 
foot," strengthening the certainty in a *self*. This helps you identify the next 
flicker as "*my* hand." Neither sensation can be separated from the mind itself,
but you project them externally anyway.

Another flicker, which you identify as a mental impression. You experience it 
as a "memory" because you believe in time. And because you consider memory to be 
*evidence* for time, this strengthens your certainty in time. Belief generates
experience, which generates belief. The snake devours its own tail. Bit by bit
you build up an entire world.

This process happens so subtly and effortlessly that it escapes your notice.
By the time you *do* notice your own experience, the narrative has been
weaved so densely and self-consistently that it appears to you as an objective
reality. And because it is happening beneath your conscious threshold, you
are convinced that the whole thing is happening *to* you, rather than you
*fabricating* it.

But you *are* fabricating it. It's just that you do it in such a subtle and
clever way that your construction appears as tangible, palpable, externally 
imposed structures: like a world *out there*. 

You will never discover the 
ruse unless your mind becomes extremely clear. Your conscious reasoning process 
happens at a much higher layer of mind, which is why it has zero insight into 
how the trick is performed, regardless of your IQ. At best you can use your
intelligence to aim your introspection in the right direction.

That is why it feels like time is "obvious," when in fact it is anything but.

---

It is hard to describe the process (or any "process") without reference to 
time, which makes it impossible to communicate accurately. How can a snake
swallow its own tail if time is an illusion it is creating? Nonetheless, it is 
something that can be experienced directly, and no less accessible in principle 
than mundane cognitive activity like "I am hungry."

The conclusion may be a bit surprising.
In a remarkable plot twist, you discover that your metaphysics is not *false,* 
per se: rather, *it is true because you make it so*.  

This process allows you to blame the whole thing on factors outside your control.
"This universe has been here for a long time, and is the reason I feel the way
I do." Any direction you care to look, you find evidence that this isn't just 
a story, but the Truth. Your own mind has arranged it so that it cannot feel 
otherwise. This is what causes you to transparently substitute "mind" with 
"brain" when you read this piece, even though it is most assuredly not what I 
mean.

All the mind needs is a seed around which to spin a story, and
it will do all the rest of the work in entrenching it, fleshing out the details,
and sealing off the exits. Your current story is called "physical reality." 
Though it is an extremely well woven sweater, you can find threads to pull on
if you really want.

At this point you must be wondering: "couldn't it be the case that there
really *is* a world out there, which is causing the whole process you describe?"

Instead of answering directly, let's look at some related questions:

* Whether or not there is an external reality, how much leeway do I have in
constructing my private reality? I clearly have some freedom to interpret it, 
but how deep does this freedom go?

* As I discover more and more freedom, won't I become less and less certain
about externally imposed constraints? If I had *infinite* freedom, wouldn't this
demolish my belief in an external reality? Wouldn't that be terrifying, and 
wouldn't that terror limit the degree of freedom I am willing to explore?

* Is there any *physical* evidence that "my reality" and "the world out there" 
are not two separate things? What would such evidence even look like?

In truth, your belief in an external reality is generated in the same way as 
your belief in time: you can't help but believe that it's logical, even though 
the real causes are profoundly emotional.

In most polite presentations of Buddhism, they tend to tread very lightly here.
Nonetheless, if you read between the lines, you will discover what they are
really trying to say.

For now, let us turn our attention to the very reasonable concern of *fear*.
