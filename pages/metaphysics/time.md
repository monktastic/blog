On the face of it, the question of why you believe in time might seem 
absurd: *obviously* it is logical to believe in time, and illogical to 
believe otherwise.

But careful reasoning reveals that
it is no more logical to believe in the past than not: [all attempts to justify
time end up *presupposing* it in one way or another](past.html). 
And something with only
*circular* justification has *no* justification. Spend as much time as you need
to convince yourself of this fact: there is no (non-circular) evidence of a
past.

Okay, well if it is not *logical*, then at least it is *practical*, right? But
even this conclusion is circular: how can you know whether something is
*practical* if this is the only moment that exists? You have to *assume* that
there have been other moments to determine whether the belief has been 
practical.

Once you really see this, there's not much more you can do than throw your 
hands up and say "reasoning be damned; it is perfectly sensible to treat time
as an axiom!"

Which is totally fine -- unless you happen to be the kind of person who wants
to understand *why* you do things. Where exactly does this compulsion to believe 
come from, if not from logic?

The next easy answer is that perhaps "my reptilian brain is causing me to do it, 
and my prefrontal cortex has no say in the matter." This is certainly internally
consistent: it's evolutionarily advantageous to believe in things that are real,
so perhaps it's been built deep into our brain structures and beyond our 
control.

On the other hand, if the world popped into being *now*, I could *still* be 
giving this answer. Perhaps it is not so convincing as it seems at first glance.

It seems that every time we try to answer *why*, our mind produces a satisfying 
explanation that would requires careful consideration to detect as circular. 
It is as though the mind is erecting one "Do Not Enter" sign after another to
dissuade you from peeking behind the curtain. "It's logical." "It's practical."
"It's inevitable." "Shut up, we like it!"

We are like Truman in the Truman Show, as the show's producers generate an 
increasingly stormy sea to prevent him from discovering the truth.

This analogy goes deeper than you might think, as we shall explore later.

It's a rare individual who cares enough about the truth to actually proceed
beyond this point. If you're perfectly content with your worldview and would
rather not rock the boat too much, this is probably a good time to find 
something better to do. On the other hand, it's probably safe to proceed anyway:
your mind has a dazzling array of powerful defense mechanisms to protect you 
from seeing too much, too soon.

Let us forge ahead and discover where our conviction about time really comes 
from. To do that, we will have to take a whirlwind tour of meditation.
