On the face of it, the question of why you believe in time might seem 
absurd: *obviously* it is logical to believe in time, and illogical to 
believe otherwise.

But careful reasoning reveals that
it is no more logical to believe in the past than not: [all attempts to justify
time end up *presupposing* it in one way or another](past.html). 
And something with only *circular* justification has *no* justification. 
Spend as much time as you need
to convince yourself of this fact: **there is no evidence of a past** -- unless 
*for some strange reason* you are willing to overlook the fallacy of circular 
reasoning just when it suits you.

Okay, well if it is not *logical*, then at least it is *practical*, right? But
even this conclusion is circular: how can you know whether something is
*practical* if this is the only moment that exists? You have to *assume* that
there have been other moments to determine whether the belief has been 
practical. Even ignoring this fact, you have to admit that your conviction goes
*far deeper* than mere practicality.

Once you really see this, there's not much more you can do than throw your 
hands up and say "reasoning be damned; it is perfectly sensible to treat time
as an axiom!"

Which is totally fine -- unless you happen to be the kind of person who wants
to understand *why* you do things. Where exactly does this compulsion to believe 
come from, if not from logic?

The next easy answer is that perhaps "my reptilian brain is causing me to do it, 
and my prefrontal cortex has no say in the matter." This is certainly internally
consistent: it's evolutionarily advantageous to believe in things that are real,
so perhaps it's been built deep into our brain structures over the millennia
and is now beyond our control.

While that *could* be true, we *still* have no reason to believe it:
"I believe in time because time made me do it" is as circular as the rest,
if perhaps more deviously convincing.

It seems that every time we try to answer *why*, our mind generates another
circular answer that still somehow pacifies us.
It is as though the mind is erecting one "Do Not Enter" sign after another to
dissuade you from peeking behind the curtain. "It's logical." "It's practical."
"It's inevitable." "*Shut up, we like it!*"

We are like Truman in the Truman Show, as the show's producers generate an 
increasingly stormy sea to prevent him from discovering the truth.

Let us forge ahead and discover where our conviction about time really comes 
from. But first, let's take a brief detour into the strange world of abnormal
psychology.
