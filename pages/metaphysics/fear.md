[Alan Wallace, Buddhist teacher and former translator for the Dalai Lama](http://realitysandwich.com/150759/daytime_practices_dream_yoga/):

> Padmasambhava gives us the essential, specific instruction for daytime dream yoga practice: "At this time, powerfully imagine that your environment, city, house, companions, conversation, and all activities are a dream; and even say out loud, This is a dream.' Continually imagine that this is just a dream."

> Depersonalization-derealization disorder ... can be very disturbing and may feel like you're living in a dream.

[Khenpo Palden Sherab](http://www.turtlehill.org/khen/kind.html):

> When you see yourself as a Buddha, you do not simply consider yourself as Buddha and the rest of the world as ordinary, but  everything is transformed into that state, both subject and object, the universe and all sentient beings, everyone is in that Buddha field together. This is known as true visualization.

> Grandiose delusions... are a subtype of delusion that occur in patients suffering from a wide range of psychiatric diseases.... Other common grandiose delusions in schizophrenia include religious delusions such as the belief that one is Jesus Christ.

):

> True understanding is to see the events of life in this way: 'You are here for my benefit, though rumor paints you otherwise.' And everything is turned to one's advantage when he greets a situation like this: You are the very thing I was looking for. Truly whatever arises in life is the right material to bring about your growth and the growth of those around you. This, in a word, is art-- and this art called 'life' is a practice suitable to both men and gods. **Everything contains some special purpose and a hidden blessing**; what then could be strange or arduous when all of life is here to greet you like an old and faithful friend?

> Ideas of reference and delusions of reference describe the [psychotic] phenomenon of an individual's experiencing innocuous events or mere coincidences and believing they have strong personal significance. It is "the notion that everything one perceives in the world relates to one's own destiny".

What is it that prevents methods of wisdom from leading to insanity?

A reasonable first guess is that techniques for wisdom are not meant
to be taken literally. This is not *really* a dream; you are not *really*
the Buddha; the events in your life aren't *really* about you.

But while such a guess serves as a powerful defense against seeing
too much too soon (for which you should be deeply grateful), at some 
point on the path it may become useful to know that this is not the 
whole story.

There *is* a sense in which those things are *actually* true, but
for them to blossom into realization and not insanity, you must already
have a very deep base of meditative practice. 

Rather than try to
communicate this myself, I'd like to share a beautiful piece.


[Schizophrenia, Enlightenment](http://greengaze.blogspot.com/2009/07/g-everything-is-connected-but-some.html)

> G – Everything is connected, but some things lie closer together on the infinite mesh of interconnectedness than others. This is the case with schizophrenia and what is called enlightenment. They are two manifestations of the same phenomenon. In both cases the mind has come to the end of conventional thought. There are two possible reactions to this. The first is to let go of the mind and the ego. The other is to try to maintain the mind and ego in the face of the infinite, which is dangerous.

> S - Can you explain what you mean by “to the end of conventional thought”?

> G – Thought is limited. What the mind can know is limited. What can be known is infinite. When something limited comes up against something infinite, it reveals itself as being infinitely small. Some people, for whatever reason, have an experience of this infinity, this nothingness out of which all manifestation springs. When that happens, their consciousness undergoes a revolution. This is what happened to Jesus, to the Buddha, and to a great many more people who we have never heard of. This is also what happens to what we call schizophrenics, although their consciousnesses are prevented from undergoing the same revolution due mainly to fear. They are afraid—and this is not a judgement of them—of letting go of their egos, of their thoughts, and of falling back into that infinite nothingness that they have become aware of. Of course, it is impossible to try to figure out infinity, and to carry the ego into infinity.

Having identified the source of our fear, now let us turn to more
concrete matters. In the previous chapter we asked:

* Is there any *physical* evidence that "my reality" and "the world out there" are not two separate things? What would this even look like?

For example, what if there were some *physically
meaningful sense* in which your *experience of reality* could be
shown to coincide precisely with the *existence* of that reality?
What if you had experimental and theoretical evidence that certain 
features of reality are not well-defined before you (personally) see 
them?

That would sound like [quantum woo](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Quantum_woo), of course. And yet, I want to give you
all the evidence so that you can decide for yourself.
