I'd like to share some "facts." That word is in quotes not because I doubt
their authenticity, but because even if they *were* true, there would be an
immense psychological pressure not to recognize them as such. Therefore it may
be easier for you to think of them as *possibilities*.

For each, I link to my reasoning. You may decide it's the dumbest thing you've
ever read, and that's fine. Alternatively, it may make you pause and go
"hmm...." Either way, it is very much worth monitoring your mind's reaction.

With that out of the way....

1. [Believing that the past really happened is not logically justified.](past.html)
2. [Believing that the laws of nature will continue to hold in the future
is not logically justified.](future.html)
3. [You cannot be sure that anyone else is conscious.](other-consciousness.html)
4. [You can be sure that you are conscious.](your-consciousness.html)
5. [Consciousness is not physical.](consciousness-physics.html)
6. [Bonus] [One straightforward reading of quantum mechanics is that you
are the sole observer in your world.](quantum-short.html)

How are these facts best explained?

One way you are already very familiar
with: the world really *does* work the way we normally think, and even
if we don't have precise explanations yet, a combination of mathematics,
physics, biology, etc. will one day take care of them.

The other way is to face up very directly to what's being pointed out:

> "Deep in my gut, I just *know* that time is real, despite the fact that
I can find no logical justification for it. Also, by total coincidence, this
unjustified hypothesis is the root of all my regrets, grudges, anxieties,
and fears. And even when I don't feel those things, I'm bored because I've
experienced all of this 'before.'"

If your friend came to you with this concern, and replaced "time" with
"the flying spaghetti monster (FSM)" what would you say? What will you say
when he explains how science will one day prove him right, as it has with
everything else? A science whose very validity *depends* on the FSM? Hopefully
you'd give him the big hug he deserves. His position is cleverly immune to
logic.

You are the victim of a very crafty and virulent sort of Stockholm Syndrome.
And yet your prison warden is nobody but yourself.

Luckily, solipsism is not actually the answer, either. The truth is far
stranger and infinitely more beautiful than extremes like materialism or
solipsism. When you try to project something infinite onto a finite mind, you 
can only get a distortion.

On some days, when you
lighten the burden of your past and the constraints of your future, you get
a *tiny* whiff of the truth. It feels like the incomparable joy of freshly
rediscovering *life*. But for some reason you never let the process go to
completion. Just when you begin to sense the boundaries dissolving, you
quickly stuff the whole world back into your limited worldview and close the 
lid.

> "If what you're saying is true, there ought to be a way to prove it!"

There *is*. It's just that this is *your* dream (roughly speaking), and so *you* 
will have to retrace your steps to the place where you exiled the very
evidence you seek. Nobody is going to do it for you.

This, in a nutshell, is the path of meditation.
