## Summary

> "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." --
Philip K Dick

It is not possible to prove that the past really happened. We cannot
even say that it "probably" happened without making assumptions that
can only be justified through circular reasoning. Ultimately, our
decision to believe in time is *pure preference*.

It is possible and beneficial to have a *functional* belief in physical
reality without taking it *literally*.

To do so, you will need to "root your mind" and gain access to the
layers that give rise to your metaphysics.

There are some practical benefits that are easy to communicate.

There are other benefits which can only sound like lunacy until you
have at least partially unveiled the metaphysical machinery.

## Unpacked

### Layers of mind

The mind is made up of many layers. Normally we only have access to
very superficial layers, in which our conscious thought is
unfolding. Your thoughts as you read this reside in these upper layers.

When you begin to meditate, you will discover layers of thought that
you normally do not notice but are nonetheless consciously accessible.
A good analogy is when you are reading a book, only to discover
that your eyes have been scanning the page while your mind was
elsewhere. Those thoughts are consciously accessible, but below the
threshold of awareness.

You have many thousands of such thoughts a day. If you learned to notice
them, a lot of your mood and personality could be understood on a level
that is not possible otherwise. This accounts for the commonly
recognized benefits of meditation.

### What lies beneath

If you keep digging, you will discover the extremely subtle mental
processes that give rise to your experience of reality itself, and
discover how they are self-reinforcing. The mind labels an experience
as "memory," which it takes as evidence for a real past. Being such a
deep layer of mind, that conclusion manifests as a visceral *experience
of* time. This produces the illusion that the experience is happening
*to you* (rather than you fabricating it), and this "external
validation" provides justification for itself.

In a remarkable twist, you discover that your metaphysics is not
*false,* per se: rather, *it is true because you make it so*.

At this point, the smokescreen is woven tightly enough that it can
trivially parry intellectual attacks from higher layers. Behold the
dazzling array of techniques your mind is currently employing to
disbelieve what is written here. There is a **profoundly meaningful**
sense in which our own mind gives rise to the entire
thing-we-call-reality (henceforth, just "reality"),
but without seeing it for ourselves, the most we are willing to do is
approximate this with something like "there is a *real* reality, and our
*brain* gives rise to our personal experience of it." This is a powerful
defense mechanism, and you should be grateful for it.

What remains when you stop believing cannot be put into words, and
whatever approximation you are forming right now is hopelessly
inaccurate.

### The glory

If you manage to stop taking reality for granted for even a moment, it
is felt as profoundly liberating. This is similar to not taking some
particular thing (say, your health) for granted, but *infinitely* more
expansive. It is as though you are repeatedly overwhelmed with the
incomprehensible miracle of existence, and are suddenly free to
reinterpret life events in a healthier context.

The sheer glory, awe, and wonder can only be approximated with very
low fidelity while remaining shoehorned inside your worldview, such as
when you are in awe of a scientific theory. And even
when we do have a genuinely transcendent experience, our mind rushes
to fit it into a framework (whether scientific or religious).

As you put your world in a healthier context, things in life often seem
to work out better. You utterly forgive your wife for a long-held
grudge, and she suddenly becomes more loving. Sometimes this kind of
thing happens even when your worldview cannot accommodate it: your wife
was halfway around the world, and you hadn't even communicated.

### The mission

You are confronted with a choice: do I stay comfy in my metaphysics
and potentially circumscribe the degree of healing that is possible,
or do I venture out into the unknown? Do I continue to fabricate a
world in which such things have never happened, giving me the evidence
I need to demonstrate that they can't?

How you respond will depend on your training and readiness.

### The path

Insanity is what occurs when the deepest layers of mind are generating
a reality that higher layers refuse to align with. It is a distinct
possibility if you try to force your way into realization without
preparation, such as taking psychedelics for the "wrong reasons."

The mission laid out by the Buddha (amongst others) is to progressively
but completely relax this death-grip on our worldview and see for
ourselves what remains. It would be absurd to believe you have any
such ability without significant practice. A high IQ can easily be used
to strengthen the mind's deceptions. Luckily, in conjunction with
meditation, there are many complementary practices we can employ:
radical gratitude, radical forgiveness, radical self-compassion....


## Time is a lie

Young earth creationists believe that the earth was created in the past
ten thousand years. The neo-creationist Omphalos Hypothesis explains
that dinosaur bones and other seemingly old artifacts might have been
planted there recently by God as a test of our faith.

As ludicrous as this may strike you, there is no logical contradiction
in it. In fact, there is no way to disprove that the universe sprang
into existence, fully-formed, last Thursday. The
mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell took it one step further:

> "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a
population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past."

Taken to its logical limit, this may all have appeared freshly in *this*
very moment, the past being nothing but an illusion. You can even
apply that reasoning now. Or now. Or now. Perhaps you never actually
read the above paragraphs, but just popped into existence with the
memory of having done so.

But while such a claim is not logically *impossible*, it is certainly
very *improbable*. Right?

Well, stop for a moment and consider how you might evaluate such a
probability. Suppose you have two models to choose from: one in which
everything suddenly appeared exactly as it is now (let's call this the
Russell metaphysics), and the other is the default model of materialism.
What evidence will you use to decide in favor of one or the other?

A moment's thought will reveal that any facts gleaned from the world
are fully compatible with either model. As such, they should not bias
you toward believing in one or the other. As an example, suppose you are
trying to determine whether an unseen coin is a nickel or a quarter. If
you are told that it was flipped and came up heads, this shouldn't cause
you to favor either answer. Even if you were told the results of one
thousand tosses, you still have learned nothing. You need evidence that
*differs* in the two cases, and we've purposely constructed Russell to
be *identical* in all appearances to materialism.

Okay, so all physical evidence is out. You could try to argue that on
theoretical grounds, it's absurdly unlikely for such a complex world to
spring into existence from nowhere. But this involves circular
reasoning: it *presupposes* that what we know about the world is true.

You may try to use Occam's Razor to make a case, but again you must be
careful. If your argument relies on anything from the past -- such as
evidence suggesting that simpler models tend to be correct -- then
you are again *assuming* your metaphysics in order to prove it. You may
use Occam's Razor in its aesthetic form (namely, that simpler models are
more beautiful and thus preferable), but then you are not stating a
*probability* but a *preference*.

No matter how you slice it, the only way you can say it is "likely" that
the past really happened is by making assumptions that can only be
justified through circular reasoning. Ultimately, your decision to
believe in time is *pure preference*.

Nonetheless, it is such an incredibly *strong* preference that it may
be hard to recognize as one. Such a conclusion is uncomfortable, and
this discomfort is good enough reason to believe in time -- logic be
damned. Russell:

> “Skepticism, while **logically impeccable**, is **psychologically
impossible**, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any
philosophy which pretends to accept it.”

Same with David Hume (whose brilliant Problem of Induction similarly
refutes the rationality of using the past to make any predictions about
the future):

> "Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument which
I have been to such pains to inculcate, whether I be really one of those
skeptics who hold that everything is uncertain, I should reply that
neither I nor any other person was ever sincerely and constantly of
that opinion. I dine, I play backgammon, I converse and am merry with
my friends and when after three or four hours of amusement I would return
to these speculations, they appear so cold and strange and ridiculous
that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any further. Thus the
skeptic still continues to reason and believe, though he asserts he
**cannot defend his reason by reason.**"

And finally, modern physicist Sean Carroll:

> “There is **no way** to distinguish between the scenarios by
collecting new data.
>
> What we’re left with is our choice of prior credences. We’re allowed
to pick priors however we want—and every possibility should get some
nonzero number. But it’s okay to set our prior credence in radically
skeptical scenarios at very low values, and attach higher prior credence
to the straightforwardly realistic possibilities.
>
> Radical skepticism is less useful to us; it gives us no way to go
through life. All of our purported knowledge, and all of our goals and
aspirations, might very well be tricks being played on us. But what
then? We cannot actually act on such a belief, since any act we might
think is reasonable would have been suggested to us by that annoying
demon. Whereas, if we take the world roughly at face value, we have a
way of moving forward. There are things we want to do, questions we
want to answer, and strategies for making them happen. **We have every
right to give high credence to views of the world that are productive
and fruitful, in preference to those that would leave us paralyzed
with ennui.**”

In other words: since there is no logical justification for preferring
one view over the other, we should just pick whichever is productive
and comforting. Actually, without trusting the past and future, we
cannot even confirm that our view is *productive*. What that leaves us
with is that *we should believe in the past because it is comforting*.

Pause for a moment to appreciate this. Is your past really so
comforting?

Now I want to call your attention to the gaping chasm between
understanding this point intellectually, and what you feel in your gut.
You may *understand* that you have no reason to believe in time, but
don't you nevertheless *feel* viscerally certain about it -- far beyond
what can be attributed to mere convenience? What gives rise to this
discrepancy?

How about this: having an accurate model of reality confers evolutionary
fitness, and since time and space really do exist, our reptilian brain
has evolved to model things this way. Our higher brain can't help it!

And in the snap of a finger, your faith in the model is restored, even
though we *just* saw why this is illogical. This remarkable self-healing
property of your worldview should make you a little suspicious, and if
it doesn't, then *that* should give you pause.

*Reality is what remains when you stop believing. But there are some
things you can't stop believing. And anyway if you tried it would be
boring and pointless. Hey, remember that time we were mistreated?*

This series is about how it is possible to have a *functional* belief
in physical reality without taking it *literally*, and why this may be a
very good thing.


- Is there any value in radical skepticism? (My view helps me design things that
help people. What does yours do?). To answer this, we'll need to dig in to:

- Where does this assumption come from? We've just seen that it can't come from
the evidence.

- What explains this discrepancy between our intellectual understanding and our
deep beliefs?

- We've also seen that rationality cannot help us decide. But irrationality is a
path to madness. Do we really have to throw in the towel (as these great
thinkers suggest), or are there other tools available to us?

- What would happen if I stopped believing?

* Consider your regrets, grievances and anxieties. Don't they rely on time being
real?





Layers of thought: a whirlwind tour of meditation

Have you ever had the experience of reading a book, only to discover that your
eyes are still scanning the page but your mind is elsewhere? If you're
interrupted mid-reverie, chances are you can recall the past few seconds of
thought. Those thoughts were not really outside of consciousness and yet,
somehow, you weren't really noticing them.

Chances are, you spend the vast majority of your day in such a state. The mind
readily back-fills a sense of presence, so that you can easily convince yourself
that you were present when you weren't. Beginning meditators can spend months
believing they've been following their breath, only to discover that they've
been lost in thought the whole time without noticing it. If it's that hard to
catch even when your whole being is engaged in the effort, what of the rest of
the day?


If you decide to progress on the path of meditation, this
distraction-without-knowing-it starts happening less and less. As you become
more present, you begin to detect an undercurrent of more subtle thoughts
flowing between the big, coarse ones. When even these quieten, and you're
sitting in a seemingly thought-free state, you might consider yourself basically
free of thought.

But are you really?

If you still feel like a self sitting in a world of space and time, it's because
there's still a layer of your mind you have not yet penetrated.

If you look carefully enough, you will notice that your mind is subtly but
continually weaving a narrative from your experiences. Sensations must imply
objects. Memory implies a past; anticipation implies a future; together they
imply time and a self. Etc. The sense that the past contained a physical world
bolsters the certainty that this moment must, too, and that there will be
similar moments to come, following a fairly predictable trajectory. This
narrative becomes the "background" of your experience -- feeling as though it
has been given to you or is happening to you, rather than you actively
fabricating it.


But you are fabricating it. It's just that you do it in such a subtle way that
your construction appears as tangible, palpable, externally imposed structures:
like a world out there. This seeming externality further cements your confidence
in using it as evidence. Isn't it viscerally obvious that time and space are
real, and not merely assumptions? That viscerality isn't happening to you; you
are creating it. But you treat this conclusion as evidence for itself, creating
a closed feedback loop. And it is this self-reinforcing loop that gives rise to
the palpable sense of a physical reality.



Like with distracted reading, the process simply escapes your notice, allowing
you to blame the whole thing on factors outside your control. "This universe has
been here for a long time, and for some reason gave birth to me." Any direction
you care to look, you find evidence that this isn't just a story, but the Truth.
Sshh, there there, go back to sleep, you've got it all figured out.



In other words, all the mind needs is a seed around which to spin a story, and
it will do all the rest of the work in entrenching it, fleshing out the details,
and sealing off the exits. You call this story "physical reality."



There's a powerful meme going around that says that believing in materialism is
a sign of maturity and grit.



- Don't confuse "mind" with "brain."





You see, it's not that your metaphysics is false, per se. Instead, it's true
because you make it true.



Reality is indeed what remains when you stop believing. But why on earth do we
think we're capable of stopping something as deeply embedded as belief when we
can barely even notice the voluminous cacophony much closer to the surface?

Life before metaphysics
Let us try to unravel our metaphysics. To do so, we will need to use poetic
language. Ignore the literal meaning of the words here, and allow them to be
pointers to your own experience.



Okay.



Silence is the absence of sound. Now, pay attention to any particular sound in
your environment, and recognize it as the presence of sound. "A sound" is some
particular presence of sound.

Now close your eyes and notice a (relative) absence of light/color. Now look at
something, and recognize it as the presence of color.

You can do the same thing with your other senses. Compare the presence of a
feeling (like pressing your fingers together) with an absence of feeling (in
that location, at least).


Now let us try to abstract away this fact of presence from its details (as
sights, sounds, etc.).


The senses are all different modes of presence, but what they have in common is
presence itself. Spend a minute and see if you can intuit what I might mean when
I say that presence is the very "stuff" out of which all experiences are made.
Presence, modulated in various ways, is the sole substance of your perceived
world. Really take a moment and notice this.

It is also the sole substance of your thoughts, memories, emotions, etc. Every
single thought you've ever thought, like every sound you've ever heard, is "made
of presence." When you're not paying careful attention to your mind -- which, as
we saw before, is almost always -- it is easy to overlook this insight. Even if
you understand it intellectually (and especially if you don't), it is worth
seeing for yourself.


Slowly (perhaps over the course of years) you may discover that even your sense
of identity is just a cluster of thoughts. You may already know this from
neuroscience, but now you begin to experience it directly. The illusion of
someone sitting inside your head, looking out at a world, starts to evaporate.


As this happens, you might start to reevaluate the belief that "I am conscious."
Who, pray tell, is conscious, if there's nobody there?

And now, slowly, slowly, it occurs to you that "consciousness" is just another
word for what we've here been calling "presence." It's not that there is some
object called a sound, and a subject called I, and some abstract property called
"consciousness" that magically links the two. Or rather, while that model of
reality may be useful, it's not your actual experience of the world -- even
though it has always seemed like it due to unexamined conceptualization.
Instead, this shimmering show you call "life" or "reality" is all made of
consciousness -- merely experiencing or illuminating itself.

So now what do you do with a belief like "consciousness exists" or
"consciousness does not exist?" You discover, directly, that those beliefs are
made of the very "stuff" they are questioning. Even the concept of "exists" or
"real" are made of it. Any answer you might muster is also it.

The sweater begins to unravel. A remarkable charade is exposed.

In each moment, the luminous fabric of consciousness weaves itself into a
dazzling array of sensual delights, as well as a thicket of mutually reinforcing
beliefs that together form your conception -- and thence experience -- of
reality. Whether or not any of those beliefs are true, it is astonishing to
discover how these beliefs form (and re-form) in each moment.

You really must see it for yourself.

Remarkably, during this model-building phase, consciousness brilliantly hides
itself from itself, taking on fiendishly clever forms such as "the stuff of the
world (aka matter) is all that really exists; consciousness is just an
illusion." And like a snake eating its own tail... poof!, the sole substance of
your reality seemingly vanishes into itself.

But it's always hiding in plain sight. It is what the Tibetans call
"self-secret." It's not that some yogis in an ancient cave have been hiding it
from you. It is everything. Yet somehow you are continually hiding it from
yourself. This game of hide-and-seek is known as Awakening, and they say it can
go on for as many cycles (lifetimes) as you wish.

So close you can't see it
So simple you can't believe it
So deep you can't fathom it
So good you can't accept it

-- Tibetan Buddhist saying

It would be premature to conclude that consciousness is real while everything
else isn't. But, being the very fabric from which your beliefs are made, it is a
good place to hunt for the thread that unravels it all.



- What motivation do we have to save a world in which nothing is really alive?
None, and that is why we are destroying it.

So what?
What happens when you notice this?



First, notice the remarkable self-healing property of your metaphysics. After
reading the above, you must be thinking something like "So what? A physical
brain becomes capable of noticing how it constructs its (good) model of reality.
Big deal."



Like with any tightly held belief, it's often impossible to get us to question
it through reasoning alone. And this one is tightest of all. Perhaps only the
act of seeing yourself constructing the thing you believe gives rise to your
beliefs is powerful enough to give you pause.



What happens when you pause?



First, notice that when you expect something, you take it for granted. Now
notice that in each moment, you expect to be alive; for a world to keep
appearing. It's obvious.



If you could for a moment see that there is genuinely no reason to believe that
you've been alive before, and no reason to assume it will continue to happen,
you would be overwhelmed with gratitude, wonder, awe, and joy beyond your
wildest imagination.



We approximate this glory from within our metaphysics whenever we look up at the
stars and marvel at their beauty, how we are all made of star stuff, the
immensity of the Big Bang, evolution, or the remarkably low odds of our
existence. But in my experience, it is not possible to have a genuinely
transcendent experience without transcending your entire belief structure,
however briefly.



Next, notice how much of our behavior is constrained by our past baggage and
beliefs about our futures. We hold these very tightly. When these are profoundly
relaxed, we become free to reinvent ourselves. Life feels free and open, and
that feeling of freedom becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: we accomplish more
simply by dropping the beliefs that hold us back.



But perhaps this is just scratching the surface of what is possible.



From time to time, maybe something happens that makes you deeply question
whether it can really be accounted for by your comically limited metaphysics. At
this point you have two options: hit the snooze button and stay wrapped in your
warm, comfy metaphysics; or wake up and follow the rabbit on down the hole....





(Mingyur Rinpoche quote)



* It is not "likely" that materialism is true.

* Even knowing this intellectually, it still feels viscerally true.

* When you try to understand why, it just heals itself.

* Mindless reading, layers of thought, the layer responsible for generating a
self-healing sense of reality.

* The nature of consciousness. Consciousness being the world. The suspicion that
there's something behind it is alleviated when you see that you are behind it.
Couldn't there still be something behind that? It would be like asking "how do I
know that it's not the puppets pulling on my hands pulling on their strings?"



* QM and being the sole observer.

- This is another way of saying that there is only one consciousness
(manifesting as the world).

- AFAWK, there is no reason to believe that there is a law of physics governing
which branch you end up in.
